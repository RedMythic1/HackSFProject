It demonstrates the potential of combining multiple pre-trained models to achieve high-quality music generation. This model can be further improved by incorporating more data and fine-tuning the models. The implications of this research are vast, as it opens up new possibilities for music creation and composition. As technology continues to advance, we may see the emergence of more sophisticated music generation models that can rival human composers. However, the question remains: will these models be able to capture the emotion and creativity that human composers infuse into their work?", "timestamp": 1746582534}
