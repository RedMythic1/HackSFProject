The FTC has jurisdiction over a wide range of economic sectors and pursues law enforcement, advocacy, research, and education to achieve its goals. The agency's work is performed by the Bureaus of Consumer Protection, Competition, and Economics, aided by the Office of General Counsel and eight regional offices. Since its creation in 1914, the FTC has evolved to include consumer protection laws such as the Telemarketing Sales Rule, the Pay-Per-Call Rule, and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. The FTC will never demand money or personal information from individuals and encourages them to report any illegal business practices or scams through the ReportFraud.ftc.gov website.\n\n\n**Source 2**: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission)\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is an independent agency of the United States government responsible for enforcing civil antitrust law and protecting consumers. The FTC was established in 1914 in response to the monopolistic trust crisis and has since enforced the provisions of the Clayton Antitrust Act and the FTC Act. The agency has the power to regulate a variety of industries, including the funeral home industry, and has implemented regulations such as the Funeral Ruling to protect consumers from deceptive practices. In recent years, the FTC has taken action against companies engaging in transaction laundering and producing predatory journals. The agency is composed of five commissioners who are nominated by the President and subject to Senate confirmation, and no more than three commissioners can be from the same party.\n\n\n#### What are unfair or deceptive fees?\n\n**Source 1**: [https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/rule-unfair-or-deceptive-fees-frequently-asked-questions](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/rule-unfair-or-deceptive-fees-frequently-asked-questions)\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission's Rule on Unfair or Deceptive Fees, effective May 12, 2025, prohibits certain pricing and fee tactics used in live-event tickets and short-term lodging to misrepresent total costs.
