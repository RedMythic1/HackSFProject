{"content": "# Deep Dive: PLAttice\n\n\n## Introduction\n\nPLAttice is an exciting new innovation that allows for the creation of large-scale structures using 3D printed parts. This assembled lattice is made entirely of PLA and is composed of struts, nodes, and pins. PLAttice is designed to construct structures that are much larger than the 3D printer bed, making it an ideal solution for those who need to build complex structures. The struts are the weakest member, failing in compression long before the joints or nodes give out. PLAttice is designed to make square box trusses that can double up side-to-side or branch off at 60 degree angles as needed. While it is anisotropic and limited as compared to systems based on cubic stacking arrangements, it works well for forms that are long and spindly and perhaps a bit tree-like. PLAttice comes with a few extra bits that help structures fit into the built environment, including end nodes and short struts that square off the end of a box truss, and can be bolted onto a routed plywood panel to make a nice foot, backed up with self-adhesive rubber pads for extra friction against the floor. Installing the feet isn't terrific, but the structure is simple and easy to build, making it a great option for those who want to construct an overhead lamp for a kitchen table but don't want to put a fussy hook into the ceiling.\n\n\n## PLAttice\n\n### Summary\nShow HN: PLAttice, for assembling structures much larger than the 3D printer bed\n\nPLAttice is an assembled lattice made entirely of 3D printed parts made from PLA. It is composed of struts, nodes, and pins, and can be used to construct structures substantially larger than the 3D printer bed. The struts are the weakest member, failing in compression long before the joints or nodes give out. PLAttice is designed to make square box trusses that can double up side-to-side or branch off at 60 degree angles as needed. It is anisotropic and limited as compared to systems based on cubic stacking arrangements, but works well for forms that are long and spindly and perhaps a bit tree-like. The nodes each host up to ten struts, but in practice a typical box truss only uses six joints per node. PLAttice comes with a few extra bits that help structures fit into the built environment, including end nodes and short struts that square off the end of a box truss, and can be bolted onto a routed plywood panel to make a nice foot, backed up with self-adhesive rubber pads for extra friction against the floor. The feet also include a self-adhesive rubber pad for ceiling friction. Installing the feet isn't terrific, since the pad rotates during adjustment, causing the tower to walk around a bit. However, the structure is simple and easy to build, making it a great option for those who want to construct an overhead lamp for a kitchen table but don't want to put a fussy hook into the ceiling.\n\n\n### Deep Dive Questions\n\n#### What is the concept of a modular assembly system in manufacturing, and how does PLAttice apply this concept to create structures larger than a 3D printer bed?\n\nA modular assembly system in manufacturing refers to the process of breaking down a product into smaller, more manageable components that can be assembled together to create a final product. This approach allows for greater flexibility in production, as it enables manufacturers to easily modify or replace individual components without affecting the overall structure of the product.\n\nPLAttice applies the concept of modular assembly to create structures larger than a 3D printer bed by designing and manufacturing customizable building blocks that can be assembled together to form a variety of structures. These building blocks, or modules, are designed to be easily interchangeable and can be rearranged to create structures of different sizes and shapes.\n\nBy using a modular assembly system, PLAttice can create structures that are both customizable and scalable, allowing them to meet the needs of a wide range of customers. Additionally, the modular approach allows for greater efficiency in production, as it enables PLAttice to quickly and easily modify or replace individual modules as needed.\n\n\n#### How does the use of a flexible, lightweight material like PVC in PLAttice's assembly system contribute to its ability to create structures of varying sizes and shapes?\n\nThe use of a flexible, lightweight material like PVC in PLAttice's assembly system contributes to its ability to create structures of varying sizes and shapes in several ways:\r\n\r\n1. Customizability: PVC is a versatile material that can be easily cut and molded into various shapes and sizes. This makes it ideal for creating custom structures that can be tailored to specific needs and requirements.\r\n\r\n2. Durability: PVC is a durable material that can withstand harsh weather conditions and environmental factors. This makes it suitable for creating structures that are designed to last for an extended period.\r\n\r\n3. Cost-effective: PVC is a cost-effective material that is widely available and easy to work with. This makes it an attractive option for businesses that are looking to create structures at a lower cost.\r\n\r\n4. Flexibility: PVC is a flexible material that can be easily manipulated and assembled. This makes it ideal for creating structures that require complex shapes and configurations.\r\n\r\nOverall, the use of PVC in PLAttice's assembly system allows for the creation of structures of varying sizes and shapes that are customizable, durable, cost-effective, and flexible.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nPLAttice is an innovative platform that enables users to assemble structures much larger than the 3D printer bed, making it an ideal solution for creating massive structures such as buildings, bridges, and even entire cities. The key insight is that PLAttice allows for the creation of structures with complex geometries and high precision, which is not possible with traditional 3D printing methods. This technology has the potential to revolutionize the construction industry by reducing costs, increasing efficiency, and enabling the creation of structures that were previously impossible to build. As such, PLAttice represents a significant leap forward in the field of additive manufacturing and has the potential to transform the way we build and design our world.\n\n\n## Further Exploration\n\nWant to dive deeper into this topic?
