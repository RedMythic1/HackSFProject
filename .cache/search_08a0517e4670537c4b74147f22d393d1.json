[{"url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10879", "summary": "In this paper, the authors prove that the element $h_6^2$ is a permanent cycle in the Adams spectral sequence, thereby resolving the final case of the Kervaire invariant problem. This result, combined with previous theorems, establishes the existence of smooth framed manifolds with Kervaire invariant one in dimensions 2, 6, 14, 30, 62, and 126. The paper provides a detailed proof of this result and contributes to the ongoing research in algebraic topology, differential geometry, and geometric topology."}, {"url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10879", "summary": "Error generating final summary."}]
