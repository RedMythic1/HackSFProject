This result establishes the existence of smooth framed manifolds with Kervaire invariant one in dimension 126, and when combined with the theorems of Browder, Mahowald--Tangora, Barratt--Jones--Mahowald, and Hill--Hopkins--Ravenel, it is concluded that smooth framed manifolds with Kervaire invariant one exist in and only in dimensions 2, 6, 14, 30, 62, and 126.

The authors use a combination of computational methods and theoretical tools to establish this result, including the use of the May spectral sequence, the Leibniz rule, and the Mahowald trick. The paper also provides a summary of the history of the Kervaire invariant problem and its relationship to other problems in differential topology.", "is_pdf": true}]
