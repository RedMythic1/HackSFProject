It includes code, exercises, and solutions for popular algorithms, designed to complement the theoretical materials from Sutton's book and Silver's course. Each folder corresponds to one or more chapters and includes learning goals, concept summaries, and links to relevant readings. The code is written in Python 3 and uses OpenAI Gym for RL environments, while advanced techniques use Tensorflow for neural network implementations. The repository also includes textbooks, classes, talks/tutorials, other projects, selected papers, and additional resources.", "is_pdf": false}, {"url": "https://github.com/guilhermeverissimo/sutton-barto", "summary": "The repository guilhermeverissimo/sutton-barto on GitHub contains the author's own implementations of exercises and examples from the introductory book of Sutton & Barto [1].
