It is a project that combines the obsessions of its creators, who are all power users of software that helps them organize and clean up their workflow. The browser has a radically different user experience that aims to solve the problem of information loss and overload. It allows users to create workspaces that hold apps and pages related to a project or task, and presents them in a list format. Users can quickly find pages in their history and already-open pages across workspaces, and navigate to them quickly. SigmaOS also has a split-screen feature that allows users to quickly open a second webpage, and an intuitive and easy-to-learn repertoire of keyboard shortcuts for all the most-used commands and actions. The browser connects users' web apps and browsing activity to understand the context around their actions and searches, and organizes information by projects, making it shareable and collaborative. SigmaOS charges $15 per month, with no ads and no data monetization.", "is_pdf": false}, {"url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/yli.html", "summary": "Title: Unknown Title No substantial content found on the Hacker News page.", "is_pdf": false}]
