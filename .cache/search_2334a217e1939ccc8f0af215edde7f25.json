[{"url": "https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~nhnguyen/metric_learning.pdf", "summary": "The paper presents a metric learning algorithm based on a margin-based approach using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) framework. The algorithm learns a Mahalanobis distance function by minimizing a quadratic objective function subject to local neighborhood constraints. The local neighborhood constraint ensures that examples of the same class are separated from examples of different classes by a margin. The algorithm is able to handle non-linear separable cases by utilizing the kernel trick. Experiments with various data sets show that the algorithm produces a better distance function that helps improve the performance of KNN classification in comparison to other state-of-the-art metric learning algorithms.", "is_pdf": true}, {"url": "https://opensourceconnections.com/blog/2022/10/26/what-is-vector-search-a-guide-to-the-new-frontier/", "summary": "Vector search is a new approach to search that uses machine learning algorithms to capture the meaning and context of words and phrases. It is an extension of traditional search engines that can handle different types of data like images, sounds, and other content as vectors. Vector search algorithms use a nearest neighbor approach to find the most similar documents to a query, which can be useful in cases where the intent of the query is not clear or when the source document contains complex information. Vector search can also be used for multimodal search, which includes different types of content at the same time. The complexity and richness of the source data can be captured and established connections between documents in the collection and between documents and queries in a more expressive way. Machine learning approaches such as Learning to Rank are now commonly used in search applications, and the cost of training a machine learning model on a particular content set should be considered.", "is_pdf": false}, {"url": "https://jpt.spe.org/top-machine-learning-algorithm-explained-support-vector-machines", "summary": "Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a popular supervised-learning algorithm used for solving both regression and classification problems. They were first introduced by B. E. Boser et al. in 1992 and have become widely used due to their success in handwritten digit recognition in 1994. SVMs work by finding the optimal decision boundary that maximizes the distance between the decision boundary and all instances, also known as the margins. This is achieved by building a nonprobabilistic binary linear classifier that assigns new examples to one category or the other. The objective of SVMs is to find the best hyperplane in more than two dimensions that separates the space into classes. The hyperplane is found through the maximum margin, which is the maximum distance between data points of both classes. SVMs are powerful, but the concepts behind are not as complicated as you might think.", "is_pdf": false}, {"url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0965997817307792", "summary": "Error generating final summary.", "is_pdf": false}, {"url": "https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/res-6-002-electromagnetic-field-theory-a-problem-solving-approach-spring-2008/aadd00c4927436002530deb5b73a273a_MITRES_6_002S08_chapter1.pdf", "summary": "Chapter 1 of the text provides a brief review of vector analysis, focusing on the essential mathematical tools needed throughout the text. The chapter begins with a discussion of coordinate systems, including the rectangular (Cartesian), circular cylindrical, and spherical coordinate systems. The rectangular coordinate system is the most common and often preferred, with the unit vectors i, i, and i2 pointing in the direction along one of the coordinate axes. The chapter then moves on to discuss vector algebra, including scalars and vectors, multiplication of vectors by scalars, and addition and subtraction of vectors. The chapter concludes with a discussion of differential volume and surface area elements in each of the three coordinate systems.", "is_pdf": true}]
