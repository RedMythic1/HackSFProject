[{"url": "https://itsfoss.com/systemd-init/", "summary": "Systemd vs init is a longstanding debate in the Linux community that centers on the best way to manage Linux-based systems. Systemd, introduced in 2010, is a system and service manager designed to improve boot-up speeds and manage system services more efficiently. It has become the default init system for many popular Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, Fedora, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux. While systemd has many features, such as parallelization and advanced logging capabilities, it has also sparked controversy due to concerns about complexity, compatibility, and potential for breaking traditional Unix tools and utilities. Despite these concerns, systemd has become widely accepted and appreciated by many in the Linux community."}, {"url": "https://www.tecmint.com/systemd-replaces-init-in-linux/", "summary": "The Story Behind 'init' and 'systemd': Why 'init' Needed to be Replaced with 'systemd' in Linux The init daemon, which starts as soon as the computer starts and continues running until it is shut down, is the first process that starts at boot and is typically assigned \"pid=1\". It is the parent of all other running processes directly or indirectly. However, the init process starts serially, which often results in delayed and long booting times. Systemd, a system management daemon, was designed to overcome these shortcomings and was initially released under GNU General Public License but is now released under GNU Lesser General Public License. It is designed to start processes in parallel, reducing boot time and computational overhead. Systemd has many features, including simpler boot processes, concurrent and parallel processing at boot, better API, simple unit syntax, ability to remove optional components, low memory footprints, improved technique to express dependencies, initialization instruction written in config file and not in shell script, and more. Many Linux distributions have already implemented systemd, and it is expected to become the standard init replacement in the future."}]
