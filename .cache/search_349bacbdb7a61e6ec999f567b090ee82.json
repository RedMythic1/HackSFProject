It describes the action of being and is the third person singular form of the verb \"to be.\" In a sentence, \"is\" refers to the subject's relationship with a noun or adjective. It can also be used as an auxiliary verb to support the main verb in the sentence. Every form of \"be,\" including \"was,\" \"been,\" \"are,\" and \"am,\" can function as auxiliary verbs.

Its conjugations depend on the subject and verb tense, and there are many different forms to choose from. The correct conjugation to use depends on the subject's person and number, as well as the verb tense. In the present tense, singular subjects use \"is\" while plural subjects use \"are.\" However, in the simple past tense, \"was\" and \"were\" are used instead. When using \"to be\" as a noun, it can be singular or plural, and the same rules apply. Questions follow the same rules as other sentences, but the order of the words may be different. Compound subjects, which describe two or more subjects connected by \"and\" or \"or,\" can also be singular or plural, and the usage depends on the context. Some indefinite pronouns, like \"everyone,\" can be both singular and plural, and the usage depends on the context.

The subject of a sentence determines which word to use. \"Is\" is used with pronouns such as \"she,\" \"he,\" and \"it,\" while \"are\" is used with pronouns such as \"you\" and \"they.\" Verbs are typically considered irregular if their past tense form and/or past participle are not formed by adding \"-ed\" or \"-d\" to the end of their root form. \"Be\" is an especially odd case of an irregular verb as it changes considerably when conjugated into its different forms. The verb \"be\" is conjugated as follows: \"is\" is used with a third person singular subject, while \"are\" is used with a second person singular subject or any plural subject. Sentences that use the pronoun \"you\" can be confusing, as both the singular and plural \"you\" use the same form. To determine whether to use \"is\" or \"are\" after \"there,\" swap \"there\" with the noun or noun phrase that follows the verb.
