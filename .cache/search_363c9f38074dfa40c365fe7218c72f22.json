Unlike traditional search engines that rely heavily on keyword matching, Exa's technology is built on neural networks capable of understanding the deeper meaning behind queries. This allows Exa to provide results tailored precisely to the information that both human users and AI applications genuinely seek. Exa's unique approach excels particularly well in sophisticated, multi-criteria searches. The company's API (Application Programming Interface) enables other applications and AI systems to send queries to Exa and get back rich results in real time. Exa's marketing strategy focuses on engaging with the developer community and AI enthusiasts, highlighting concrete achievements and metrics to showcase its unique capabilities. The company's vision is to become the search backend for a variety of use cases without requiring users to visit a new search site.", "is_pdf": false}, {"url": "https://exa.ai/blog/websets-evals", "summary": "In this post, Will Bryk announces the launch of their new search product, \"Websets\", which retrieves over 20x more correct search results than Google on complex queries. The author explains that while Google is great for simple searches, it struggles with complex ones. They built Websets to enable these valuable queries by deploying an army of agents that use a custom embedding-based search algorithm. The author then walks through a benchmark test that compares Exa Websets, Google, and OpenAI's Deep Research. They found that Exa Websets outperformed both Google and Deep Research in their benchmark. The author explains that they created a minimally-biased benchmark by using one-shot sampling from o1 and manually grading each result based on the same criteria. The graph below shows the number of matching results for each search engine, with Websets (high compute) getting the highest number of correct results per query on average. The author concludes that Websets is 20 times better than Google in their evaluation.", "is_pdf": false}]
