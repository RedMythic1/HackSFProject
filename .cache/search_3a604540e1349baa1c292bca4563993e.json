AI programmes can process large amounts of data, identify patterns, and follow detailed instructions about what to do with that information. They are used in various fields such as personalized social media feeds, medical breakthroughs, voice-controlled virtual assistants, self-driving cars, and content recommendation systems. However, the rapid growth of AI has raised concerns about its potential misuse, ethical complexities, and environmental impact. Some experts predict that AI could affect nearly 40% of jobs and worsen financial inequality. There are also concerns about the tech's potential to reproduce biased information, discriminate against some social groups, and make humans extinct. Despite these concerns, AI continues to be a major part of everyday life, and its use is expected to increase in the future.", "is_pdf": false}, {"url": "https://medium.com/@saqikhosa17/what-is-technology-how-does-it-work-3f2629b98ca3", "summary": "Technology is a crucial aspect of modern life, transforming how we communicate, work, learn, and entertain ourselves.

It has evolved over millennia, from simple tools like stone axes to complex systems like the internet. The story of technology is the story of human ingenuity, with each stage in human history defined by technological progress. Today, technology influences nearly every aspect of our lives, from how we communicate to how we travel, work, and entertain ourselves. It serves as a catalyst for social change, economic growth, and cultural transformation. Whether it's the invention of the printing press, the steam engine, or electricity, each breakthrough has reshaped society and the economy. In recent times, the development of computers, the internet, and mobile technologies has revolutionized how we live and interact with the world. From the wheel to smartphones, each innovation has made life easier or more efficient. Technology is not a monolith; it exists in many forms, each serving a unique purpose. Let's dive into the different categories of technology that influence your daily life. Information technology (IT) refers to the systems and devices used to store, process, and communicate information. Medical technology has saved countless lives and improved the quality of healthcare around the globe. Environmental technology, or \"green tech,\" includes innovations that aim to reduce pollution, conserve resources, and promote sustainability. Technology has transformed the way people interact with each other, reshaping social interactions, economies, and even culture. It has both enriched cultural diversity and raised concerns about the spread of misinformation and the commodification of art. The current trends show that the pace of innovation is accelerating, with emerging technologies poised to redefine industries and daily life. Artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, and quantum computing are just a few examples of emerging technologies that are reshaping the future. Despite technological advancements, not everyone has equal access to technology. The digital divide refers to the gap between those who have access to modern technologies and those who don't. Bridging the digital divide requires not only providing access to technology but also ensuring that people have the skills to use it effectively. With great power comes great responsibility, and nowhere is this truer than in technology. The ethical implications of innovations like AI, genetic engineering, and autonomous weapons raise important questions about how far we should go in the pursuit of progress.", "is_pdf": false}, {"url": "https://icoverage.io/Technology/What-Is-Technology-Meaning-Types-And-Impacts-Explained", "summary": "Technology refers to the study of diverse techniques used to perform various tasks, and it has become an indispensable aspect of human life.
