This abstract space allows models to handle complex data more effectively by focusing on the most significant aspects of the data. Autoencoders, VAEs, GANs, RNNs, LSTMs, and Transformers are some of the neural networks that use latent space for various tasks such as data compression, generation, and sequence modeling. Visualizing latent space can provide insights into how a model represents data, and techniques such as t-SNE and PCA are often used for this purpose. Understanding and leveraging latent space is crucial for developing more sophisticated and powerful models in deep learning.", "is_pdf": false}, {"url": "https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/latent-space", "summary": "Latent space is a compressed representation of data points in machine learning that preserves only essential features that inform the input data's underlying structure. It is an integral part of deep learning, including most generative AI algorithms. Encoding latent space typically involves dimensionality reduction, which is the compression of high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space that omits irrelevant or redundant information. Latent space plays an important role in many fields of data science, and encoding latent space is an essential step in many modern artificial intelligence algorithms. For instance, generative models such as variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks compute the latent space of training data to then interpolate from it to generate new data samples. Computer vision models trained for classification tasks map input data to latent space to isolate its qualities that are relevant to making accurate predictions. Large language models manipulate latent space to explore complex connections between different words in specific contexts.", "is_pdf": false}]
