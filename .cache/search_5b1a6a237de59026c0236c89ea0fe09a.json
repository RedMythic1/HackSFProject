The Federation brings together scientists from Cambridge, ETH Zurich, Harvard University, and the University of Chicago to explore the chemical and physical processes of living organisms and environmental conditions hospitable to supporting life on other planets. The collaboration aims to establish a stable funding platform to create opportunities for creative and innovative ideas and enable young scientists to make a career in this new field. The founding centres of the Origins Federation are The Origins of Life Initiative (Harvard University), Centre for Origin and Prevalence of Life (ETH Zurich), the Center for the Origins of Life (University of Chicago), and the Leverhulme Centre for Life in the Universe (University of Cambridge). The Federation is open to new members, both centres and individuals, and is committed to developing the mechanisms and structure to achieve that aim."}, {"url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK230211/", "summary": "The Origin of the Universe, Earth, and Life is a topic that has fascinated scientists and laypeople alike for centuries. The scientific explanation of evolution, which encompasses the processes by which planets, stars, galaxies, and the universe form and change over time, is rooted in the discovery made by Edwin Hubble in the late 1920s that distant stars and galaxies are receding from Earth in every direction. This led to the hypothesis of an expanding universe, which has been confirmed through numerous and repeated measurements since Hubble's time. The Big Bang theory, which emerged from this hypothesis, suggests that the universe was more condensed at a previous time and that all the currently observed matter and energy in the universe were initially condensed in a very small and infinitely hot mass. The theory also predicts that the temperature in deep space today should be several degrees above absolute zero, which has been confirmed by observations. From the Big Bang, matter collected into clouds that began to condense and rotate, forming the forerunners of galaxies. Within galaxies, changes in pressure caused gas and dust to form distinct clouds. In some of these clouds, where there was sufficient mass and the right forces, gravitational attraction caused the cloud to collapse. If the mass of material in the cloud was sufficiently compressed, nuclear reactions began and a star was born. Some proportion of stars, including our sun, formed in the middle of a flattened spinning disk of material. In the case of our sun, the gas and dust within this disk collided and aggregated into small grains, and the grains formed into larger bodies called planetesimals. These planetesimals coalesced into the nine planets and their numerous satellites. The rocky planets, including Earth, were near the sun, and the gaseous planets were in more distant orbits. The ages of the universe, our galaxy, the solar system, and Earth can be estimated using modern scientific methods. The age of the universe can be derived from the observed relationship between the velocities of and the distances separating the galaxies. The age of the Milky Way galaxy has been calculated in two ways: one involves studying the observed stages of evolution of different-sized stars in globular clusters, and the other is based on the present abundances of several long-lived radioactive elements in the solar system. Both methods agree with each other and are consistent with the independently derived estimate for the age of the universe. The"}]
