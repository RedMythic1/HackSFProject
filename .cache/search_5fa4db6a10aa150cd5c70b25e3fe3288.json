In Southern Florida, the Miami Dialect has emerged as a new narrative in the linguistic tapestry, shaped by the cultural heritage and history of the city. The dialect is a complex and interconnected thread in Florida's sunlit cityscape, and it is a reflection of the unique identity and cultural heritage of its speakers. To better serve all users without bias, AI must adapt to regional dialects, as they play a pivotal role in fostering inclusivity. Dialects are variants of a language that can differ in pronunciation, vocabulary, or grammar, and regionality, ethnicity, or social groups can influence the type and frequency of variation within a language's dialect. The Miami Dialect is primarily shaped by Spanish and English, reflecting the cultural heritage and history of the city. The dominant innovation found in the Miami Dialect is the use of \"calques,\" direct translations of common Spanish phrases and idioms into English, which is a reflection of the multiple waves of migration that can be traced to the Cuban exodus of the 1960s, interwoven with the fabric of the English spoken by Miamians today. As we continue to rely on AI for everyday tasks, it becomes crucial for language models to reflect the diversity of human expression. Models trained solely on traditional forms of English may struggle to understand and communicate effectively with speakers of non-standard and emerging dialects. This diversity in language use alongside an ever-changing linguistic terrain presents a significant challenge for natural language processing (NLP) technologies, such as sentiment analysis, machine translation, and voice recognition. AI that cannot communicate or understand certain dialects doesn't just limit people's ability to leverage the technology but also runs the risk of further dividing cultures by erasing identities. By embracing linguistic diversity in AI, we can create more inclusive and comprehensive models that better reflect the eclectic world we live in. This also presents an opportunity for AI to become a bridge between different cultures and languages, promoting understanding and connection.", "is_pdf": false}]
