The rule prohibits hidden fees for live events, hotels, and short-term rentals, as well as practices such as \"bait-and-switch pricing\" and any actions that conceal or misrepresent total prices and fees. The FTC has published a new FAQ to guide businesses on pricing transparency. The rule will impact businesses, including live-event ticket sellers and short-term lodging providers, like hotels, motels, Airbnb, or VRBO. Third-party platforms, resellers, and travel agents are also covered by the new regulation. The FTC notes that businesses must disclose any excluded charges from the total price before asking for payment. The rule is a landmark regulation that marks a significant win for consumers who have been frustrated for years about hidden fees.", "is_pdf": false}, {"url": "https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/rule-unfair-or-deceptive-fees-frequently-asked-questions", "summary": "The Federal Trade Commission's Rule on Unfair or Deceptive Fees, effective May 12, 2025, prohibits certain pricing and fee tactics used in live-event tickets and short-term lodging to misrepresent total costs.
