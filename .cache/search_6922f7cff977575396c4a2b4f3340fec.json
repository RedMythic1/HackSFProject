[{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kervaire_invariant", "summary": "The Kervaire invariant is a mathematical concept that measures the possibility of a framed (4k+2)-dimensional manifold being surgically converted into a sphere. It is defined as the Arf invariant of the skew-quadratic form on the middle-dimensional homology group of the manifold. The Kervaire invariant is named after Michel Kervaire and Cahit Arf, and it has important implications for the classification of exotic spheres and the study of differential topology. The Kervaire invariant problem is the question of determining in which dimensions the Kervaire invariant can be nonzero. For differentiable manifolds, this can happen in dimensions 2, 6, 14, 30, 62, and possibly 126, and in no other dimensions. In 2024, a preprint by Weinan Lin, Guozhen Wang, and Zhouli Xu settled the case in dimension 126, proving the existence of smooth framed manifolds with Kervaire invariant one."}, {"url": "https://people.math.rochester.edu/faculty/doug/otherpapers/Jones-KerInv.pdf", "summary": "Error generating final summary."}]
