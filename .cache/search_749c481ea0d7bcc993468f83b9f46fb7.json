Researchers have long been interested in understanding which dimensions can host particularly strange shapes, known as exotic spheres. These spheres are so twisted that they cannot be converted into a sphere through a simple procedure called surgery. Mathematicians have now put the finishing touches on a story of dimensional weirdness that has been 65 years in the making. They have shown that there are only a few dimensions that can host these exotic spheres, and that dimension 126 is one of them. The proof, which uses a combination of computer calculations and theoretical insights, is a monumental engineering project that has left mathematicians in a curious position. Out of the entire infinitude of possible shapes in possible dimensions, the shapes in precisely one dimension still resisted classification. In the words of one mathematician, there was \u201ca big loose end.\u201d It took the form of dimension 126.", "is_pdf": false}, {"url": "https://www.simonsfoundation.org/2009/07/20/mathematicians-solve-45-year-old-kervaire-invariant-puzzle/", "summary": "A team of mathematicians has solved a 45-year-old puzzle about the shape of high-dimensional spaces. They found that all \"framed\" shapes of dimension higher than 126 are related to spheres in a certain fundamental way. This finding has startled mathematicians, many of whom expected the opposite to be true. Over the past four decades, many mathematicians have tried and failed to settle the question. The new method shows a path up a previously inaccessible mountain, and the new finding concerns manifolds, shapes that are made by gluing together pieces of ordinary Euclidean space. The research bridges two different ways to study these shapes: topology, which is concerned with the way a shape is connected up, and differential topology, which studies shapes that are smooth enough to allow the use of ideas from calculus. In 1956, John Milnor showed that in dimension 7, there exist manifolds that have the same topology as an ordinary seven-dimensional sphere, but have a different differential structure. The natural next questions were to determine in what other dimensions these manifolds exist, where they do exist, and how many different ones are there. In the 1960s, Milnor and the late Michel Kervaire, and then William Browder, took a stab at answering this question. They showed that in almost all dimensions, every manifold can be converted into an exotic sphere by performing a process called surgery. In surgery, a part of the manifold gets drilled out, and a new piece is glued in along the boundary of the excised piece. The researchers showed that if mathematicians can get a handle on which manifolds are related to each other via surgery, they can figure out how many exotic spheres there are. The work of Milnor, Kervaire, and Browder left an important gap. They didn't know what happens in dimensions of the form 2n\u2013 2, for whole-number values ofn: that is, dimensions 2, 6, 14, 30, 62, 126, 254, 510, etc. In these dimensions, it was conceivable that some manifolds might exist that could not be surgically related to a sphere.
