[{"url": "https://umatechnology.org/downtime-prevention-in-kubernetes-pods-recommended-by-sres/", "summary": "This article outlines best practices for preventing downtime in Kubernetes pods, as recommended by Site Reliability Engineers (SREs). These practices include using ReplicaSets and Deployments for high availability, configuring health checks for liveness and readiness probes, implementing rolling updates and rollbacks, managing resources efficiently, utilizing node affinity and anti-affinity rules, implementing network policies, employing persistent storage strategies, leveraging observability and monitoring tools, adopting chaos engineering practices, establishing incident response plans, integrating CI/CD pipelines with Kubernetes, following security practices, and standardizing environments. By implementing these practices, SREs can ensure that Kubernetes clusters maintain uptime, support businesses in delivering consistent and high-quality user experiences, and prevent downtime incidents that can lead to lost revenue and diminished customer trust."}, {"url": "https://mefmobile.org/how-to-monitor-container-orchestration-with-zero-downtime-policy/", "summary": "Container orchestration has become increasingly popular in modern technology landscapes due to its ability to enhance application deployment and scalability. However, monitoring these complex environments, especially when aiming for a zero-downtime policy, presents challenges. This article discusses various strategies and tools that organizations can implement to effectively monitor container orchestration while maintaining a commitment to zero downtime. These include implementing health checks and probes, using distributed tracing, centralized logging, collecting metrics, and visualization, and adopting service mesh architectures. Additionally, the article emphasizes the importance of standardizing monitoring metrics, adopting a proactive monitoring approach, conducting regular audits, building a culture of collaboration, investing in training, and testing in production. By following these best practices, organizations can harness the full potential of containerization while ensuring a seamless user experience, even in times of change or disruption."}]
