Today, the term \u201cAI\u201d describes a wide range of technologies that power many of the services and goods we use every day \u2013 from apps that recommend TV shows to chatbots that provide customer support in real time. However, there is a debate over whether these technologies actually constitute artificial intelligence as most people envision it. AI is an umbrella term that encompasses a wide variety of technologies, including machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing (NLP). Despite the many philosophical disagreements over whether \u201ctrue\u201d intelligent machines actually exist, when most people use the term AI today, they\u2019re referring to a suite of machine learning-powered technologies that enable machines to perform tasks that previously only humans can do like generating written content, steering a car, or analyzing data.", "is_pdf": false}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/technology/artificial-intelligence", "summary": "Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to a computer's ability to perform tasks that require human-like reasoning, such as discovering meaning, generalizing, or learning from past experience. While there are no AIs that can match full human flexibility over wider domains or in tasks requiring much everyday knowledge, some AIs can perform specific tasks as well as humans. Machine learning is a method used to train a computer to learn from its inputs without explicit programming for every circumstance. It helps a computer to achieve artificial intelligence. The term AI is frequently applied to the project of developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans. Since their development in the 1940s, digital computers have been programmed to carry out very complex tasks with great proficiency. However, there are still no programs that can match full human flexibility over wider domains or in tasks requiring much everyday knowledge. Some programs have attained the performance levels of human experts and professionals in executing certain specific tasks, such as medical diagnosis, computer search engines, voice or handwriting recognition, and chatbots. The behavior of the digger wasp, Sphex ichneumoneus, reveals that intelligence must include the ability to adapt to new circumstances. Psychologists generally characterize human intelligence by the combination of many diverse abilities, including learning, reasoning, problem solving, perception, and using language. There are a number of different forms of learning as applied to artificial intelligence, including trial and error, rote learning, and generalization.", "is_pdf": false}]
