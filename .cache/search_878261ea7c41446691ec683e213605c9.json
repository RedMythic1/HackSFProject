[{"url": "https://legal-wires.com/lex-o-pedia/concept-of-ownership/", "summary": "Ownership refers to the relationship between a person and the object they own, encompassing all the rights they hold concerning that object. These rights are in rem, meaning they are enforceable against the world at large, not just specific individuals. The concept of ownership is rooted in possession; in early societies, there was no notion of ownership, only possession. The idea of ownership emerged as people began to settle, build homes, and cultivate land. Different definitions of ownership emphasize various elements, such as the right to possess, enjoy, and dispose of the object, as well as the residuary character of ownership. Ownership can be acquired through two main modes: original mode and derivative mode. Modes of acquiring ownership range from original acquisition, such as through independent acts like accession, to derivative means such as purchase, inheritance, and gifts, as outlined in legal provisions like the Transfer of Property Act. Overall, ownership is a complex legal construct, with distinct variations in rights and obligations depending on the nature of the property and the legal framework governing its acquisition, transfer, and use.", "is_pdf": false}, {"url": "https://lawbhoomi.com/ownership-in-jurisprudence-meaning-kinds-incidents-and-relevance-in-contemporary-times/", "summary": "Ownership, as a legal concept, refers to the right to possess, enjoy, and dispose of a thing or property. It has evolved over time, with the earliest forms of possession emerging during nomadic times when humans did not have the skill of cultivation. The concept of ownership was later formulated before the concept of property, and it has since become a fundamental aspect of legal systems around the world. Ownership can be either corporeal, referring to the ownership of physical objects, or incorporeal, referring to the ownership of intangible things such as intellectual property. There are different modes of acquisition of ownership, including original, derivative, and trust ownership. Ownership can also be classified into different types, such as absolute, extinctive, accession, vested, contingent, sole, co-ownership, and joint ownership. The concept of ownership has impacted society and has been embedded in the minds of people, and it continues to evolve with changing social and economic conditions.", "is_pdf": false}]
