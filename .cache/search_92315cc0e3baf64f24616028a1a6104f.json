They have proven that dimension 126 is one of the rare dimensions that can host these shapes. The proof uses a combination of computer calculations and theoretical insights and is \"like a monumental engineering project.\" The study of these shapes has been ongoing since the 1950s, with mathematicians exploring and classifying exotic spheres and other shapes. The proof that dimension 126 can host these shapes has important implications for the study of manifolds and the relationships between spheres of different dimensions.", "is_pdf": false}, {"url": "https://www.simonsfoundation.org/2009/07/20/mathematicians-solve-45-year-old-kervaire-invariant-puzzle/", "summary": "A team of mathematicians has solved a 45-year-old puzzle about the shape of high-dimensional spaces. They found that all \"framed\" shapes of dimension higher than 126 are related to spheres in a certain fundamental way. This finding has startled mathematicians, many of whom expected the opposite to be true. Over the past four decades, many mathematicians have tried and failed to settle the question. The new method shows a path up a previously inaccessible mountain, and the new finding concerns manifolds, shapes that are made by gluing together pieces of ordinary Euclidean space. The research bridges two different ways to study these shapes: topology, which is concerned with the way a shape is connected up, and differential topology, which studies shapes that are smooth enough to allow the use of ideas from calculus. In 1956, John Milnor showed that in dimension 7, there exist manifolds that have the same topology as an ordinary seven-dimensional sphere, but have a different differential structure. The natural next questions were to determine in what other dimensions these manifolds exist, where they do exist, and how many different ones are there. In the 1960s, Milnor and the late Michel Kervaire, and then William Browder, took a stab at answering this question. They showed that in almost all dimensions, every manifold can be converted into an exotic sphere by performing a process called surgery. In surgery, a part of the manifold gets drilled out, and a new piece is glued in along the boundary of the excised piece. The researchers showed that if mathematicians can get a handle on which manifolds are related to each other via surgery, they can figure out how many exotic spheres there are. The work of Milnor, Kervaire, and Browder left an important gap. They didn't know what happens in dimensions of the form 2n\u2013 2, for whole-number values ofn: that is, dimensions 2, 6, 14, 30, 62, 126, 254, 510, etc. In these dimensions, it was conceivable that some manifolds might exist that could not be surgically related to a sphere.
