The lab has raised significant capital from investors and has developed products that have made AI accessible to regular people and everyday life. The lab has also discovered new research paradigms that have shown how OpenAI's pursuit of leadership in the field can inspire other organizations to advance the mission.

The organization's Board of Directors is exploring a structure that could involve a Delaware Public Benefit Corporation (PBC), which would allow OpenAI to raise conventional equity while ensuring its mission remains a priority. This move could also allow the non-profit arm to expand its work in areas like education, healthcare, and science, further amplifying the impact of AGI on society.

He believed that this change would financially harm the working-class communities he has spent nearly 30 years fighting to protect. Aguilar's new organization, LatinoProsperity, focuses on intergenerational wealth building, and he believed that cutting-edge AI chatbots such as ChatGPT would become an integral part of many good-paying jobs of the future. After reading about OpenAI's desires, he worried that transitioning into a public-benefit corporation empowered to chase profits would enrich the already wealthy and neglect the startup's stated mission to benefit all of humanity with AI. Aguilar decided to make a phone call that day, kicking off a series of events that eventually led him to become one of the leading voices battling over OpenAI's future and the establishment of what may become the deepest-pocketed charitable foundation in the world. Today, OpenAI's for-profit business is controlled by a nonprofit, and the returns for investors are capped. But as OpenAI's ambitions have grown, and staying on the cutting edge has required it to raise significantly more funding, investors have demanded greater payback. OpenAI said a recent $40 billion investment round propelled its valuation to $300 billion, but 75 percent of the pledged cash is contingent on the startup completing a structural revamp by early next year. A byproduct of the move, the AI startup said in a December blog post, would be the creation of \"one of the best resourced nonprofits in history\"\u2014albeit one with less power over what products OpenAI builds and for whom. Aguilar is co-steering a coalition of advocacy groups that met with San Francisco\u2013based OpenAI in March and is pushing the California attorney general's office, which regulates the state's nonprofits, to ensure that the startup's restructuring adheres to the law. Their activism has already contributed to OpenAI forming a small advisory commission that includes legendary labor activist Dolores Huerta.", "is_pdf": false}, {"url": "https://openai.com/our-structure/", "summary": "OpenAI, founded in 2015, aimed to build safe and beneficial artificial general intelligence (AGI) for the benefit of humanity. Initially, the organization was structured as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, but it became clear that donations alone would not be sufficient to fund the research and development required to achieve its mission. In 2019, OpenAI announced a new structure that combined elements of both nonprofit and for-profit models. This structure allowed OpenAI to raise capital for its mission while remaining committed to its core governance and oversight. The organization entered into a strategic partnership with Microsoft in 2019, which provided funding and resources to support OpenAI's work. OpenAI remains an independent company governed by the board of the OpenAI Nonprofit, with AGI explicitly carved out of all commercial and IP licensing agreements.", "is_pdf": false}]
