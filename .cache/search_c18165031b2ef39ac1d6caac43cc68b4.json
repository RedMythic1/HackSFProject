[{"url": "https://accent-strength.boldvoice.com/", "summary": "In this post, we explore how BoldVoice, an AI-powered accent coaching app, uses machine learning to understand accents and specifically, how strong they are. We introduce the concept of an \"accent fingerprint,\" an embedding generated by inferencing an English speech recording through BoldVoice's large-scale accented speech model. We then show how this fingerprint lives in a latent space, where distances and directions correspond to accent similarity and language background. Using PLS regression and 2D UMAP dimensionality reduction, we visualize the accent fingerprints of Victor's and Eliza's recordings in this latent space, showing how the more towards the lower left of the plot a recording is, the more \"native sounding\" and \"less strong\" its speaker's accent is. We also discuss how we can use BoldVoice's in-house suite of speech models and tools to help Victor get closer to Eliza's accent, such as by cleaning his recording or using an accent conversion model. Overall, our accent strength metric has several promising applications and can be used to explore accent fingerprints directly without engineering them for any particular task.", "is_pdf": false}, {"url": "https://www.greenbot.com/how-ai-gets-better-at-recognizing-accents-dialects/", "summary": "The article discusses the advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) transcription technology and how it has improved its understanding and accuracy over time. AI transcription tools can now recognize accents, dialects, and nuances in human speech with high accuracy, making it useful for businesses, media accessibility, and more. The article explains how AI learns to recognize accents and dialects by training on diverse datasets and using phoneme analysis. It also highlights the importance of continuous learning and feedback loops in improving the accuracy of AI transcription tools.
