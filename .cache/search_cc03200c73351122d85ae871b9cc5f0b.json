The frontier of biomedical science is rapidly advancing, bringing new opportunities for research in areas such as high-throughput molecular research, high-powered imaging studies, and population-based epidemiological studies. However, these developments are placing new demands on approaches to research funding and management, requiring greater strategic planning and coordination of investigators. The text also highlights the importance of clinical research in informing and stimulating fundamental science, and the need for greater integration of knowledge gained from different types of research. Finally, the text discusses the challenges and opportunities presented by international and economic factors, such as the threat of bioterrorism and the increasing global nature of science.", "is_pdf": false}, {"url": "https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6549017/", "summary": "The text discusses the challenges and opportunities of interdisciplinary research, which involves scientists from different disciplines working together to address complex problems. The need for interdisciplinary research has arisen as scientists have realized that particular problems cannot be effectively addressed by a single field of study. The text highlights the importance of disciplinary knowledge as a prerequisite for interdisciplinary research, but also notes that exaggerated claims about its presumed liberating and innovative nature can be limiting. The text discusses the limitations of the disciplinary organization of knowledge and the increasing appeal to alternative approaches, such as multidisciplinarity, interdisciplinarity, and transdisciplinarity. The text also notes that interdisciplinary research is underestimated due to the social organization of science and academic patterns of knowledge production and evaluation being ingrained in the disciplinary scheme.", "is_pdf": false}]
