[{"url": "https://literarydevices.net/dystopia/", "summary": "Dystopia is a literary device and genre used by writers to present a vision of the future that challenges readers to reflect on the current social and political environments in which they live. Dystopian literature often portrays society in cataclysmic decline resulting from environmental ruin, control through technology, and government oppression of individual freedom and expression. It is a significant literary device in its ability to educate readers and warn of the potentially dark consequences for humanity if changes are not made to present day societal and governmental constructs. Examples of central themes in dystopian literature include government control, environmental destruction, technological control, survival, and loss of individualism. Famous dystopian novels include Brave New World, 1984, and A Clockwork Orange, while famous dystopian movies include The Hunger Games and The Matrix.", "is_pdf": false}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dystopia", "summary": "Dystopia is a literary and societal concept that portrays a world or society in which people lead wretched, dehumanized, and fearful lives. It is an imagined place characterized by environmental degradation, totalitarian governments, and other characteristics associated with a cataclysmic decline in society. Themes common in dystopian societies include complete control over people, censorship of information, worship of an unattainable goal, loss of individuality, and heavy enforcement of conformity. Dystopian fiction is distinct from post-apocalyptic fiction, and an undesirable society is not necessarily considered dystopian. Dystopian societies appear in many sub-genres of fiction and are often used to draw attention to societal issues such as politics, economics, religion, psychology, ethics, science, and technology. Some authors use the term \"dystopia\" to refer to existing societies, many of which are, or have been, totalitarian states or societies in an advanced state of collapse. Dystopian fiction reflects the concerns and fears of its creators' contemporaneous culture and can be considered a subject of social studies.", "is_pdf": false}]
