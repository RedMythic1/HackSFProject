The rule prohibits hidden fees for live events, hotels, and short-term rentals, as well as practices such as \"bait-and-switch pricing\" and any actions that conceal or misrepresent total prices and fees. The FTC has published a new FAQ to guide businesses on pricing transparency. The rule will impact businesses, including live-event ticket sellers and short-term lodging providers, like hotels, motels, Airbnb, or VRBO. Third-party platforms, resellers, and travel agents are also covered by the new regulation. The FTC notes that businesses must disclose any excluded charges from the total price before asking for payment. The rule is a landmark regulation that marks a significant win for consumers who have been frustrated for years about hidden fees.", "is_pdf": false}, {"url": "https://www.pcmag.com/news/ftc-finalizes-rule-to-ban-hidden-fees-for-live-events-rentals-before-may", "summary": "The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has finally implemented a rule that bans hidden fees in live event tickets and short-term lodging. Starting May 12, businesses must inform consumers about the total price they will have to pay for live-event tickets or short-term lodging in their ads and other promotional offers. They are allowed to hold back certain fees, such as taxes, government charges, shipping charges, and charges for optional goods or services people may select, until checkout. The total price must include all known charges and fees and be displayed more prominently than other charges. Businesses can't misrepresent additional fees and charges, either. These guidelines are applicable for live events such as concerts, sporting events, music, theater, and other performances that audiences watch live. They don't apply to pre-recorded audio and visual performances and film screenings. Airbnb has already started displaying the total price upfront ahead of the rule change.", "is_pdf": false}]
