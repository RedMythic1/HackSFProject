[{"url": "https://www.captechu.edu/blog/ethical-considerations-of-artificial-intelligence", "summary": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is advancing at an unprecedented pace, raising profound ethical concerns regarding ownership, accountability, and long-term implications for humanity. As technologists, ethicists, and policymakers grapple with the future of AI, ongoing debates about control, power dynamics, and potential for AI to surpass human capabilities highlight the need to address these ethical challenges in the present. The White House has recently invested $140 million in funding and provided additional policy guidance to understand and mitigate these challenges, enabling AI's immense potential. Some of the most pressing ethical issues surrounding AI today include societal biases in algorithms, lack of transparency and accountability in decision-making, ownership and commercialization of AI-generated art, the spread of misinformation and disinformation, data privacy and human rights, job displacement, and the development of AI-powered autonomous weapons. Addressing these issues requires collaboration among technologists, policymakers, ethicists, and society at large, establishing robust regulations, promoting diversity and inclusivity in development, and fostering ongoing discussions. Capitol Technology University offers a comprehensive program of study in computer science, artificial intelligence, and data science, as well as advanced degrees like the MRes in Artificial Intelligence and PhD in Artificial Intelligence, equipping students with the knowledge and perspective to address emerging issues at the intersection of AI and ethics.", "is_pdf": false}, {"url": "https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9921682/", "summary": "The article \"Ethical Dilemmas and Privacy Issues in Emerging Technologies: A Review\" examines the ethical dimensions and dilemmas associated with emerging technologies such as Cloud Computing, Autonomous Vehicles, Artificial Intelligence, Big Data and Machine Learning, and Cybersecurity. The paper focuses on ethical and privacy issues related to enabling technologies and provides insights into the existing regulatory frameworks, policies, and ethical limitations of these technologies. The authors examine the privacy and data security metrics from a regulatory and compliance point of view, as there have been various successful cyberattacks due to the poor implementation of regulations and controls in the Industrial IoT environment. The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 elaborates different aspects that relate to cyber ethics; Section 3 discusses cloud ethics; Section 4 highlights ethical concerns in autonomous vehicles; Section 5 and Section 6 discuss ethical dilemmas in AI, Big Data, and Machine Learning; Section 7 is based on policy, privacy/compliance, and legal aspects; Section 8 concludes the paper. The paper emphasizes the importance of aligning ethical theories with regulatory laws for developing a balance in ethical/moral decision-making processes.", "is_pdf": false}]
