Researchers have long been interested in understanding which dimensions can host particularly strange shapes, known as exotic spheres. These spheres are so twisted that they cannot be converted into a sphere through a simple procedure called surgery. Mathematicians have now put the finishing touches on a story of dimensional weirdness that has been 65 years in the making. They have shown that there are only a few dimensions that can host these exotic spheres, and that dimension 126 is one of them. The proof, which uses a combination of computer calculations and theoretical insights, is a monumental engineering project that has left mathematicians in a curious position. Out of the entire infinitude of possible shapes in possible dimensions, the shapes in precisely one dimension still resisted classification. In the words of one mathematician, there was \u201ca big loose end.\u201d It took the form of dimension 126.", "is_pdf": false}]
