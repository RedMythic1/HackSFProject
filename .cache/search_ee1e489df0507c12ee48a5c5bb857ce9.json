[{"url": "https://www.quantamagazine.org/dimension-126-contains-strangely-twisted-shapes-mathematicians-prove-20250505/", "summary": "In a groundbreaking study, mathematicians have finally determined which dimensions can host the strangely twisted shapes that have been the subject of intense research for decades. These shapes, known as exotic spheres, are so twisted that they cannot be converted into a sphere through a simple procedure called surgery. The existence of these shapes is intimately connected to fundamental questions in topology about the relationships between spheres of different dimensions. The study, which has been 65 years in the making, has shown that exotic spheres exist in dimensions 2, 6, 14, 30, and 62, and that such shapes cannot exist in any other dimension except one. This final dimension, dimension 126, has been the subject of much debate and speculation among mathematicians. In a paper posted online last December, Weinan Lin, Guozhen Wang, and Zhouli Xu of Fudan University in Shanghai, along with Ulrike Tillmann of the University of Oxford, proved that dimension 126 is indeed one of the rare dimensions that can host these exotic shapes. The proof, which uses a combination of computer calculations and theoretical insights, is a monumental engineering project that has left mathematicians in awe.", "is_pdf": false}, {"url": "https://www.simonsfoundation.org/2009/07/20/mathematicians-solve-45-year-old-kervaire-invariant-puzzle/", "summary": "A team of mathematicians has solved a 45-year-old puzzle about the shape of high-dimensional spaces by showing that all \"framed\" shapes of dimension higher than 126 are related in a certain fundamental way to spheres. Their finding has startled mathematicians, many of whom expected the opposite to be true. Over the past four decades, many mathematicians have tried and failed to settle the question. The research bridges two different ways to study shapes, one called topology and the other called differential topology. The new finding concerns manifolds, shapes made by gluing together pieces of ordinary Euclidean space. The researchers have shown that if mathematicians can get a handle on which manifolds are related to each other via surgery, they can figure out how many exotic spheres there are. The work of Milnor, Kervaire, and Browder left an important gap, which the new finding has now filled.", "is_pdf": false}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exceptional_object", "summary": "The study of exceptional objects in mathematics involves examining objects of a given type and proving a classification theorem. These exceptional objects often have desirable properties and play an important role in the subject. In the case of regular polytopes, there are five Platonic solids in two dimensions, and in three dimensions, there are two more regular polyhedra. In higher dimensions, there are no regular polytopes, but there are exceptional objects such as the simplex, hypercube, and cross-polytope. The classification of Lie groups corresponds to the classification of root systems, and the exceptional Lie groups correspond to exceptional root systems and exceptional Dynkin diagrams. There are also exceptional objects with supersymmetry, such as the Lie superalgebras G(3) and F(4) and the Jordan superalgebras K3 and K10. In addition, there are exceptional codes, such as the perfect binary Golay code, and exceptional block designs, such as the Steiner system S(5, 8, 24).
