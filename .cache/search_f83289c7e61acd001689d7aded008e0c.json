The platform includes a component library for adding charts and graphs, and it aims to provide the fundamentals of programming in a way that analysts can easily make use of. Evidence is built on Svelte and Svelte Kit, and it is currently in the early stages of development. The core framework will always be open source, and eventually a paid cloud version will be launched. The team has experience working with modern data stacks and has identified the BI layer as the weakest part of the stack. They believe that treating analytics more like software development can lead to better quality outputs and a better developer experience.", "is_pdf": false}, {"url": "https://chris.cothrun.com/pinboard-bookmark/launch-hn-evidence-yc-s21-web-framework-for-data-analysts-hacker-news/", "summary": "Evidence is a static site generator designed for data analysts, similar to Jekyll or Hugo. It allows users to write SQL queries within markdown documents, which run against a database and can be referenced using a simple templating syntax. Evidence also includes a component library for adding charts and graphs, and it is different from most BI tools in that it allows data analysts to adopt software engineering practices like version control, testing, and abstraction. The assumption that data analysts are non-technical is no longer correct, and Evidence is built to cater to their needs.", "is_pdf": false}]
