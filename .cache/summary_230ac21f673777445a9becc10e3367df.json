{"title": "Rust\u2019s dependencies are starting to worry me", "summary": "Rust\u2019s dependencies are starting to worry me\n\nThe author of the blog post expresses their concern about the dependencies in Rust, specifically the maintenance and complexity of managing them. They mention the example of the dotenv crate, which was recently found to be unmaintained, leading them to question whether they even needed it in the first place. The author also discusses the complexity of managing dependencies in a project, including the number of lines of code and the difficulty of auditing all the code. They suggest that adding more to the Rust standard library could be problematic, as it would require more management and work for the Rust team. The author ultimately concludes that managing dependencies in Rust can be challenging, but they do not suggest abandoning the language altogether.", "timestamp": 1746861139.62565}
