{"title": "FTC bans hidden fees for live events and short-term rentals, effective May 12", "summary": "FTC bans hidden fees for live events and short-term rentals, effective May 12\n\nThe US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has released new documentation detailing its new \u201cRule on Unfair or Deceptive Fees,\u201d which prohibits hidden fees for live events, hotels, and short-term rentals, including practices such as \u201cbait-and-switch pricing\u201d and any actions that conceal or misrepresent total prices and fees. The rule, set to take effect on May 12, will impact businesses, including live-event ticket sellers and short-term lodging providers, like hotels, motels, Airbnb, or VRBO. Third-party platforms, resellers, and travel agents are also covered by the new regulation. The FTC has published a FAQ to guide these types of businesses on pricing transparency, and has excluded certain types of fees, such as taxes or government fees, shipping charges, and charges for optional goods or services people may select to buy as part of the same transaction. However, businesses must disclose that they have excluded charges from the total price before asking for payment. The FTC first passed the rule in December 2024, a landmark regulation that marked a significant win for consumers who have been frustrated for years about hidden fees.", "timestamp": 1746578023.39648}
