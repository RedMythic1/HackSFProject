{"title": "Jury orders NSO to pay $167M for hacking WhatsApp users", "summary": "Jury orders NSO to pay $167M for hacking WhatsApp users\n\nA jury has awarded WhatsApp $167 million in punitive damages in a case against Israel-based NSO Group for exploiting a software vulnerability that hijacked the phones of thousands of users. The verdict, reached Tuesday, is a major victory for privacy- and security-rights advocates who have long criticized the practices of NSO and other exploit sellers. The jury also awarded WhatsApp $444 million in compensatory damages. WhatsApp sued NSO in 2019 for an attack that targeted roughly 1,400 mobile phones belonging to attorneys, journalists, human-rights activists, political dissidents, diplomats, and senior foreign government officials. NSO exploited a critical WhatsApp vulnerability that allowed it to install NSO's proprietary spyware Pegasus on iOS and Android devices. The clickless exploit worked by placing a call to a target's app. A target did not have to answer the call to be infected. The verdict is a sharp rebuke of NSO's defense that it should be immune from such legal actions because it sold tools solely to licensed government intelligence and law-enforcement agencies for use in fighting terrorism, child sex abuse, and other serious crimes. The case sets a possible precedent for hacking victims and their technology providers and exposes NSO practices the company had long tried to keep secret.", "timestamp": 1746580780.070355}
