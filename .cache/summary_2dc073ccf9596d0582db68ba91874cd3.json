{"title": "Stratolaunch Successfully Completes Reusable Hypersonic Flight and Recovery", "summary": "Stratolaunch Successfully Completes Reusable Hypersonic Flight and Recovery\n\nStratolaunch has successfully completed its second hypersonic flight and recovery with the Talon-A2 (TA-2) fully autonomous vehicle in March 2025. The vehicle surpassed Mach 5 during its trajectory for the second time, exceeding the previous speed record set with the December flight. The completed flights demonstrate the United States' return to reusable hypersonic flight test since the X-15 program ended in 1968. Stratolaunch performed the flights for the Test Resource Management Center (TRMC) Multi-Service Advanced Capability Hypersonic Test Bed (MACH-TB) program under a partnership with Leidos. The MACH-TB program is intended to increase the speed of testing for all commercially available hypersonic systems. Stratolaunch's mission is to advance high-speed technology through innovative design, manufacturing, and operation of world-class aerospace vehicles.", "timestamp": 1746861126.787423}
