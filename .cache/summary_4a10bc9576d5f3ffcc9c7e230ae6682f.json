{"title": "Faster sorting with SIMD CUDA intrinsics (2024)", "summary": "Faster sorting with SIMD CUDA intrinsics (2024)\n\nThe text discusses a high-level overview of bitonic sort, a parallel sorting algorithm that can sort in O(log^2(n)) time. Bitonic sort is a species of sorting network that can be parallelized across processors, making it well-suited for GPU acceleration. The text explains how to use a SIMD-like operation called __shfl_sync to quickly sort 32-element \"vectors\" and how to optimize the algorithm to achieve a +30% performance uplift. The text also discusses the importance of constants in real-world performance and how SIMD programming can improve sorting performance.", "timestamp": 1746506095.8498402}
