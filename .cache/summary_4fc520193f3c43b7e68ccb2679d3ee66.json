{"title": "Show HN: VectorVFS, your filesystem as a vector database", "summary": "VectorVFS is a filesystem as a vector database that allows for efficient and semantically searchable storage of files. It uses embeddings to represent files and their contents, which can be used to quickly search the filesystem for specific files or content. The project is currently in development and is actively being discussed on Hacker News. Some users have suggested integrating an optional embedded Weaviate with a flat-index, which would allow for more advanced search capabilities. However, others have expressed concerns about the value add of this feature and the potential complexity of implementing it.", "timestamp": 1746489688.1794071}
