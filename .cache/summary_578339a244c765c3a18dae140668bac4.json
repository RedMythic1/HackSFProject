{"title": "Fighting Unwanted Notifications with Machine Learning in Chrome", "summary": "Fighting Unwanted Notifications with Machine Learning in Chrome\n\nChrome is launching a new feature on Android that uses machine learning to detect and warn users about potentially deceptive or spammy notifications. The feature analyzes notification content using a local, on-device machine learning model and identifies notifications that are likely to be unwanted. The model is trained on the textual contents of the notification and the analysis is done on-device to protect user privacy. The feature is currently only available on Android, but may be expanded to other platforms in the future. Chrome is committed to user safety and continually monitors threats to evolve its defenses against abusive activity across the web.", "timestamp": 1746861254.5450351}
