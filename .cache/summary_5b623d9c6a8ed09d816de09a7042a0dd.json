{"title": "Fleurs du Mal", "summary": "Fleurs du Mal\n\nFleursdumal.org is a website dedicated to the French poet Charles Baudelaire and his masterpiece, Les Fleurs du mal. The site offers the definitive online edition of this classic work, containing every poem from each edition, along with multiple English translations. Created and maintained by Supervert, the site is a labor of love that includes information about Supervert's other books. While most of the translations on the site have appeared in book form, they are included without necessarily being the best or worst, but rather ones that the site felt comfortable reproducing in terms of rights. If you are a rights holder and object to your translations being included, please contact the site. The site reserves the unconditional right to reject any submission without explanation. For those new to Baudelaire or uninterested in the various editions of Fleurs du Mal, the 1861 Table of Contents is the definitive edition that contains most everything except the \"condemned\" poems, which can be found in Les \u00c9paves. There were two editions of Fleurs du Mal published in Baudelaire's lifetime, an expanded edition in 1861, and a \"definitive\" edition appeared in 1868 after his death.", "timestamp": 1746861064.983499}
