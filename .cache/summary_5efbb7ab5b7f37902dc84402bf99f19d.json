{"title": "Sutton and Barto Book Implementation", "summary": "Sutton and Barto Book Implementation\n\nThe repository on github.com/ivanbelenky/RL contains code that implements algorithms and models from Sutton's book on reinforcement learning. The book, titled \"Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction, \" provides a comprehensive introduction to the field. The code in this repository is organized into several modules, each covering different topics. Model-free solvers work by defining states, actions, and a transition function. Transitions are defined as a function that takes a state and an action and returns a tuple of the next state and the reward. The transition function also returns a boolean indicating whether the episode has terminated. The Single State Infinite Variance Example 5 demonstrates the use of Monte Carlo Tree Search for maze solving. While the code provides a basic implementation of the algorithms from the book, it is not necessarily the most efficient or well-written. The repository serves as a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning about reinforcement learning and implementing algorithms from scratch. However, it is not production-ready.", "timestamp": 1746575000.5591612}
