The author compares the brain to a custom Linux distro trying to run Windows software, highlighting the challenges faced by neurodivergent individuals in their daily lives. The article suggests that understanding this difference in architecture can help optimize mental infrastructure for better performance and longevity. The author uses systems architecture and virtualization as metaphors to explain how containers (Docker) can offer a more efficient model for running incompatible software, and how masking can be broken down into smaller services that scale independently based on system resources. The article emphasizes the importance of building sustainable systems that run at optimal performance, and encourages the tech industry to embrace neurodivergent perspectives and innovations.", "timestamp": 1746861219.903266}
