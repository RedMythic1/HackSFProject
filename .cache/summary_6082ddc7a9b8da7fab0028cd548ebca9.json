{"title": "Old Timey Code and Old Timey Mono Fonts", "summary": "Old Timey Code and Old Timey Mono Fonts\n\nOld Timey Mono is a clean monospace typeface based on Reproducing Typewriter, a typeface designed for simulating typewritten letters in smaller point sizes for advertisements, catalogs, etc. It was developed by Darren Embry as a good basis for a coding font with an antique aesthetic. The font is suitable for screenplay writing and includes Old Timey Code, a variant with a slashed zero, disambiguated digit one, selected punctuation marks made larger, and modified small letters. The font supports extensive coverage of Latin, Cyrillic, and Greek scripts and includes a list of languages with full coverage. It is available for free and paid, with additional fonts available.", "timestamp": 1746574968.777092}
