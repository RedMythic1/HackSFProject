{"title": "AI Meets WinDBG", "summary": "The text describes a project called ChatDBG, which is an AI-powered debugging tool that integrates with various debuggers such as WinDBG, lldb/gdb, and pdb. The project uses a language server to enable the LLM to make the best use of the debugger's capabilities, including finding declarations and references to variables. ChatDBG has been out since 2023 and has been downloaded over 80,000 times. The technical paper for the project will be presented at FSE in June. The text also discusses the benefits of using a language server, including saving tokens and obtaining precise information quickly.", "timestamp": 1746489947.002304}
