{"title": "An Interactive Debugger for Rust Trait Errors", "summary": "An Interactive Debugger for Rust Trait Errors\n\nThe text describes the development of an interactive debugger called Argus for Rust Trait Errors. The debugger provides an interface into the full inference tree generated by the trait solver, allowing developers to incrementally explore the complexity of the inference tree. The debugger recommends investigating failed obligations and presents two views on the inference tree: bottom-up and top-down. The text also mentions that the debugger was tested and found to be useful in localizing trait errors 3.3x faster. The source code for Argus is available on GitHub, and it can be used as a VSCode extension on the VSCode Marketplace or the Open VSX Registry.", "timestamp": 1746514551.281832}
