{"title": "Why does Switzerland have so many bunkers?", "summary": "Why does Switzerland have so many bunkers?\n\nSwitzerland has more bunkers per capita than any other country in the world, with enough space to accommodate every resident in the event of a crisis. The country's policy to provide shelter to every citizen has been in place since 1963 and is maintained through a combination of public and private funding. The Swiss Civil Protection Department is responsible for maintaining the country's stockpile of iodine, which is used to counteract radiation exposure in the event of a nuclear attack. The Swiss people have become more aware of the need for civil protection measures since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and there has been a renewed interest in building and maintaining bunkers. The country's policy on civil protection has evolved over time, with the focus shifting from stockpiling food and supplies to building more advanced and secure shelters. Despite the increased awareness and investment in civil protection measures, Switzerland remains a peaceful country with a low risk of nuclear attack.", "timestamp": 1746507043.8514738}
