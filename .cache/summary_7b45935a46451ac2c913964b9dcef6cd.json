The company's app, TM SGNL, is interoperable with Signal and works by setting up archive plans that assign users to them, with destinations controlled by the TeleMessage customer. The app sends chat logs to the archive server, which then forwards them to the destination. However, the communication between the TM SGNL app and the final archive destination is not end-to-end encrypted, and the archive server was hosted in the public AWS cloud, which is not an approved place to store classified information. The hack of TeleMessage's archive server revealed that the communication between the app and the final archive destination is not encrypted, and that the archive server was hosted in the public AWS cloud.", "timestamp": 1746575093.724582}
