They were able to replicate the password system in Python and uncover previously unknown cheat codes that enable a stage select screen, invincibility mode, and two photo galleries. The author also found hundreds of thousands of valid passwords for the PlayStation version, but discovered that the character choices do not match up with the controller buttons for the console being played. The author then took a closer look at the password system and found that the code loaded at 06071760 checks for button presses and validates them by comparing them to substrings of the phrase \"Three Dirty Dwarves!\" The author also found four new cheat codes for the Saturn version, including an invincibility code and stage select code, and discovered that the PlayStation version's password system works differently, encoding button presses to numbers and computing a checksum. The author has previously written articles on cracking password systems for other games, and plans to continue their reverse engineering work in the future.", "timestamp": 1746861323.566252}
