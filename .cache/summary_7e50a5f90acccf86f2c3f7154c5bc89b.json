{"title": "AWS Built a Security Tool. It Introduced a Security Risk", "summary": "AWS recently introduced a security risk by allowing users to list metadata about their production accounts. This metadata includes sensitive information such as secret names, bucket names, and policy names. While listing metadata is not a security issue in itself, it can be leveraged by attackers with existing access to lower environments to escalate their privileges. The issue was reported and addressed appropriately, but it is a medium severity issue. The documentation did not explicitly recommend or automatically set up environments insecurely, but it left the commonly known best practice of disallowing trusts from lower to prod environments implicit. The account manager and enterprise support TAM can view a list of all resources on the account, including metadata like resource name, instance type, and cost explorer tags. They can also access detailed internal information about it without explicit consent. The support team can view some data about the object including monitoring data and internal logs, but accessing \"customer data\" (such as ssh-ing into an RDS instance) requires explicit, one-off consent. The S3 buckets being public by default was stopped 2 or 3 years ago, and the globally unique names of S3 could be problematic with just the metadata of name. The majority of S3 buckets, especially valuable ones, remain created back when it was the default and thus the metadata sensitivity with bucket names remains.", "timestamp": 1746489891.768724}
