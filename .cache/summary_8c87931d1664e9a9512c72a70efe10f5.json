However, they discovered that many of their friends use Gmail, which means that Google has copies of all their personal email. The author wrote a program to find out how much of their email Google has and found that about a third of their personal email comes from Google. They also found that Google delivers more than half of the email they reply to every year. The author encourages others to consider whether they really want Google to have all their email and provides Python and R code for those who want to run the analysis on their own.", "timestamp": 1746503670.834235}
