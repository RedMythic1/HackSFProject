{"title": "Critical CSS", "summary": "Critical CSS\n\nThe Critical CSS Generator from Kigo.studio is a tool that helps optimize website loading times by generating a critical CSS file that styles the initial content of the page. To use the generator, simply paste the generated CSS inside a<style>tag within the<head>of your HTML document, placing it high up before any other stylesheets or blocking scripts. It's important to remember to remove any original non-critical CSS<link>tags from the<head>once the critical CSS has been added. Additionally, for even more optimized loading, consider using JavaScript in the<head>to load non-critical styles after the page content has finished loading. Just be sure to update the `stylesheets` array and remove any original links from the<head> before doing so.", "timestamp": 1746506069.248935}
