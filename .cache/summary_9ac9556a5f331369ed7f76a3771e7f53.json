{"title": "WebGL Water (2010)", "summary": "WebGL Water (2010)\n\nThe text describes a web-based water simulation called \"WebGL Water\" created by Evan Wallace in 2010. The simulation required a decent graphics card to run smoothly, but now, even phones with integrated graphics can run it smoothly. The author of the text, Tim Schmidt, mentions that he uses Wallace's CSG.js library in his Rust CAD library and that Wallace has worked on implementing Rust and WebAssembly in production at Figma. The author also mentions that Wallace has also worked on esbuild. The text concludes with the author's observation that the simulation is running fine on an 8-year-old Xiaomi MI6, despite the fact that it requires the OES_texture_float extension, and that it is the author's most voted submission.", "timestamp": 1746860946.8103979}
