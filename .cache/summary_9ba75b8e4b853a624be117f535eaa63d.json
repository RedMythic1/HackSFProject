{"title": "Internet Roadtrip: Vote to steer", "summary": "Internet Roadtrip: Vote to steer\n\nThe Internet Roadtrip app is a fun and interactive way to explore the world through street view. Users can vote on which direction to turn and see the next street view frame in real-time. However, some users have suggested improvements to the app, such as displaying a history of past votes, notifying users of similar voters, and prefetching the next street view frames. Additionally, some users have reported inconsistent behavior with the app, where it only shows the path that the current browser has seen. Overall, the app has great potential, but there is room for improvement in terms of user experience and functionality.", "timestamp": 1746860884.2819068}
