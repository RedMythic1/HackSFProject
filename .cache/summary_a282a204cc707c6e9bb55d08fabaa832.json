{"title": "Gmail to SQLite", "summary": "Gmail to SQLite\n\nThe text describes a script that allows users to download emails from their Gmail account and store them in a SQLite database for further analysis. This script is useful for running queries on email data, such as determining how many emails were received from each sender, which emails take up the most space, and which emails from which sender were never read. The text also provides a guide on how to create the necessary credentials and run the script using Python. Additionally, the script can be used to determine which senders are spamming the user with uninteresting emails and to group newsletters by sender. While the script is not perfect, it is a useful tool for analyzing email data.", "timestamp": 1746860921.220018}
