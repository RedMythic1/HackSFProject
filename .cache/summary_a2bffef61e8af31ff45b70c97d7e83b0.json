{"title": "Evolving OpenAI's Structure", "summary": "OpenAI is changing its structure from a complex, capped-profit company to a normal capital structure where everyone has stock. This change is not a sale, but a shift to a simpler structure. The charter of OpenAI specifies that if a value-aligned, safety-conscious project comes close to building AGI before OpenAI does, they commit to stopping competing with and starting assisting that project. However, this does not mean that OpenAI is close to building AGI, as their current models are a rudimentary form of AGI. The concept of AGI is often linked with artificial consciousness, but simple \"unconscious AGI\" could be the superior technology for current and foreseeable needs. The term AGI is often redefined, and it is important to define it clearly before using it.", "timestamp": 1746489605.736948}
