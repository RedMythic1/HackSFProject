{"title": "Dimension 126 Contains Twisted Shapes, Mathematicians Prove", "summary": "Mathematicians Weinan Lin, Guozhen Wang, and Zhouli Xu have proven that 126-dimensional space can contain exotic, twisted shapes known as manifolds with a Kervaire invariant of 1. These manifolds, previously known to exist only in dimensions 2, 6, 14, 30, and 62, cannot be smoothed into spheres and were the last possible case under what's called the \"doomsday hypothesis.\" Their existence in dimension 126 was confirmed using both theoretical insights and complex computer calculations, marking a major milestone in the study of high-dimensional geometric structures.", "timestamp": 1746489753.098492}
