{"title": "Brandon's Semiconductor Simulator", "summary": "Brandon's Semiconductor Simulator is a highly educational tool that provides a unique perspective on how circuit elements work. It uses metal plates and loops to form capacitance and inductance, rather than traditional L and C elements. Sebastian Lague has also created a similar simulator that focuses on digital logic level, while Brandon's is at a level around atoms/electrons. The similarity between the two is likely not a coincidence, as both were ported to JavaScript with the help of Paul Falstad. The simulators are fun and remind the user of the long-forgotten Zachtronics semiconductor game \"KOHCTPYKTOP: Engineer of the People.\" The simulators are also available in Zach's free retrospective \"Zach-like,\" which includes a Flash emulator, making it playable on modern machines. Additionally, the Archive supports old Flash games like this via the Ruffle Flash emulator.", "timestamp": 1746860934.552255}
