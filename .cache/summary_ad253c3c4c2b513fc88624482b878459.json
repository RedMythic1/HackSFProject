The assembly manual for the Siemens PC 100, titled \"Siemens Assembler-Handbuch Personal-Computer PC 100, Ausgabe 1980/1981,\" included a section on \"Sonderbefehle,\" or special instructions, that were not part of the original MOS/Rockwell 6502 reference. These instructions were not decoded by the assembler program and had to be programmed using the BYT directive. The special commands included logical operations, memory manipulation, and arithmetic operations. It is unclear whether this information was original research by a Siemens author or copied from another source.", "timestamp": 1746861050.1090019}
