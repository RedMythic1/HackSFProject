{"title": "ALICE detects the conversion of lead into gold at the LHC", "summary": "ALICE detects the conversion of lead into gold at the LHC\n\nThe ALICE collaboration at CERN has reported the detection of the conversion of lead into gold in the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). This process, known as chrysopoeia, has been a long-standing quest of medieval alchemists, who were motivated by the observation that lead and gold have similar densities and are both coveted for their beauty and rarity. However, it was only with the advent of nuclear physics in the 20th century that it became clear that lead and gold are distinct chemical elements and that chemical methods are powerless to transmute one into the other. The ALICE team used the detector's zero degree calorimeters (ZDC) to count the number of photon-nucleus interactions that resulted in the emission of zero, one, two, and three protons accompanied by at least one neutron, which are associated with the production of lead, thallium, mercury, and gold, respectively. The results show that the LHC currently produces gold at a maximum rate of about 89,000 nuclei per second from lead-lead collisions at the ALICE collision point. However, the total amount of gold produced is still trillions of times less than would be required to make a piece of jewelry, and the dream of medieval alchemists has technically come true but their hopes of riches have once again been dashed.", "timestamp": 1746860970.732067}
