{"title": "Wrapping Paper Turns All Your Presents into Bread", "summary": "Wrapping Paper Turns All Your Presents into Bread\n\nJapanese graphic designer Ippei Tsujio has created a new type of wrapping paper that transforms gifts into loaves of bread. The wrapping paper is designed to look like freshly baked loaves of bread, with toasty brown hues, signature flour dusting, and hand-scored patterns mimicking artisanal baguettes. This innovative wrapping paper creates a visual illusion that brings the warm aesthetic of a bakery shelf right to your hands. Although the wrapping paper is currently in conceptual stages, it has the potential to become a popular product if it gains enough popularity. For now, all we can do is drool over the delicious-looking bread-inspired wrapping paper.", "timestamp": 1746506106.7400918}
