{"title": "Show HN: Tkintergalactic - Declarative Tcl/Tk UI Library for Python", "summary": "The text describes a discussion on Hacker News about the Tkintergalactic library, a declarative Tcl/Tk UI library for Python. The library is well-suited for creating semi-disposable UIs for applications where a Web server is not necessary. The discussion also touches on the lack of canvas support in the library, but the creator plans to add a way to reference specific widgets to access the raw name and run Tcl against them. Additionally, the creator mentions an upcoming AI Startup School event in San Francisco.", "timestamp": 1746489736.851833}
