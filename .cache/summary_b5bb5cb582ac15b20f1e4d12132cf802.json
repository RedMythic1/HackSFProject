{"title": "Brush (Bo(u)rn(e) RUsty SHell) a POSIX and Bash-Compatible Shell in Rust", "summary": "Brush (Bo(u)rn(e) RUsty SHell) a POSIX and Bash-Compatible Shell in Rust\n\nBrush is a POSIX and Bash-compatible shell implemented in Rust. It is built and tested on Linux and macOS, with experimental support on Windows. Brush is functional for interactive use as a daily driver and can execute most handbash scripts. Known limitations are tracked with filed issues, and contributions and feedback of all kinds are welcome. Brush is available for use and distribution under the MIT license. It can be installed using rustc or by cloning the repository and running cargo run. Brush processes bashrc and other usual configuration files, and users can customize its look with a ~/. brushrc file. Some set and shopt options are not fully implemented, and there are known gaps in compatibility. The project is primarily tested by comparing its behavior with other existing shells, and there is a long list of OSS crates that it relies on for major portions of shell functionality.", "timestamp": 1746574923.113499}
