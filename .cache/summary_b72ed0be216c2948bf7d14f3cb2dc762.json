{"title": "Catastrophic fires and soil degradation: possible link with Neolithic revolution", "summary": "Catastrophic fires and soil degradation: possible link with Neolithic revolution\n\nThe paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the environmental factors that may have contributed to the Neolithic revolution in the southern Levant. The authors use various records from the region, including micro-charcoal and isotopic data, to infer that catastrophic fires and soil erosion were likely key drivers of the agricultural transition. They argue that the environmental changes were likely caused by a climatic shift, rather than anthropogenic factors such as intentional burning. The paper also highlights the importance of wildfires in maintaining open grasslands and promoting the growth of wild ancestors of domesticated plants. Overall, the study provides valuable insights into the complex interplay between environmental factors and human behavior during the early Holocene period.", "timestamp": 1746510316.184713}
