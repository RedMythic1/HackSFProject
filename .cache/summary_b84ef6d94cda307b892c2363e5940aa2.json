{"title": "Geometrically understanding calculus of inverse functions (2023)", "summary": "The post on Hacker News discusses the geometric understanding of calculus of inverse functions. The author, tobylam, presents a proof-without-words geometrical diagram of the Legendre transform, but the inverse map definition as (x, y) to (\\hat y, \\hat x) was found difficult to understand. The author suggests an easier derivation using integration by parts, which involves defining y = g(x) for U-substitution with x = f(y) and then integrating by parts. The author also mentions a similar diagram on the Wikipedia page for Integration by Parts and links to the more specific page on Integral of inverse functions. The post also discusses the visual angle of diagrams and their potential impact on long-term memory retention.", "timestamp": 1746489831.068799}
