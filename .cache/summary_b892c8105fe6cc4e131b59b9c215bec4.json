{"title": "History of \"Adventure\" for the Atari 2600", "summary": "The text describes the history of the game \"Adventure\" for the Atari 2600, which was released in 1980. The game uses the Atari hardware to draw the player as the ball, thin walls as missiles, and two sprites on the screen. The game also uses pixel-level collision detection to check for collisions, but objects can interact in other ways, such as through the Bat and Magnet or the dragons guarding/running away from them. The bridge in the game ignores player collisions for a particular bounding box. The text also mentions a remake/update/reimagined version of the game called Pixa for iOS, which the author enjoyed playing and thought did a good job of translating the game to mobile controls. The text also discusses the author's experience porting the game into Flash and getting it DMCA-ed off for trademark reasons. The text concludes by comparing the 2600 version of the game with a fancy, ray-traced game today and discussing the role of imagination in games.", "timestamp": 1746489872.449656}
