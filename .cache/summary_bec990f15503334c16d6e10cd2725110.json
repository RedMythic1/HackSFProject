The Indian government stated that its forces had struck these sites, while Pakistani military officials claimed that only five places had been hit. The escalation has been met with mixed reactions, with some commentators predicting that it could lead to a major war if it gets out of the disputed area. Others believe that Pakistan will not escalate, as they are at a severe disadvantage unless China gives them the green light. The memeification of the current escalation has been discussed, with some arguing that memes are more powerful than people expect. The Kargil War of 1999 and the Sino-Soviet border conflict of 1969 are examples of similar situations involving two nuclear nations.", "timestamp": 1746580120.124298}
