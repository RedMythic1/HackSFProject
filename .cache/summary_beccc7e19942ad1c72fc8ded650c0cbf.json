{"title": "Show HN: Clippy \u2013 90s UI for local LLMs", "summary": "Show HN: Clippy \u2013 90s UI for local LLMs\n\nClippy is a desktop assistant that runs large language models (LLMs) locally on a computer while maintaining a 1990s user interface. It is a love letter and homage to the late, great Clippy and the visual design created by Microsoft in that era. The app is not affiliated, approved, or supported by Microsoft and is not trying to be the best chatbot. Instead, it offers a unique mix of nostalgia for 1990s technology and one of the most magical technologies available on computers today. If you're interested in downloading Clippy for your computer, you can find it on felixrieseberg.com, Blue. sky, or GitHub.", "timestamp": 1746574768.755636}
