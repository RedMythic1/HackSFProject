{"title": "Nnd \u2013 a TUI debugger alternative to GDB, LLDB", "summary": "Nnd \u2013 a TUI debugger alternative to GDB, LLDB\n\nNnd is a TUI debugger alternative to GDB and LLDB that is written in Rust. It has a series of tutorials on how to write a debugger from scratch for Windows x86-64. The book \"Building a Debugger - Write a Native x64 Debugger From Scratch\" by Sy Brand is also available. The author of Nnd has provided an overview of how a debugger works and has also shared a super cool article on the topic. Nnd has essential features such as showing code, disassembly, threads, stack traces, local variables, watches, with a little custom expression language, access to local and global variables, thread-local variables, registers, type introspection, pretty printers for most C++ and Rust standard library types, automatically down-casting abstract classes to concrete classes, breakpoints, conditional breakpoints (but no data breakpoints yet), stepping into/over/out a source code line, into/over a disassembly instruction, over a source code column (when there are multple statements one line, e.g. to skip evaluation of arguments of a function call), and debugging core dumps. The author is open to suggestions for improving the debugger and is willing to help with any sandbox projects.", "timestamp": 1746575047.543874}
