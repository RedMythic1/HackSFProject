{"title": "Open WebUI changed license from BSD-3 to Open WebUI License with CLA", "summary": "Open WebUI changed license from BSD-3 to Open WebUI License with CLA\n\nOpen WebUI, an independent project built and maintained by a small team, has changed its license from BSD-3 to Open WebUI License with CLA. This change was made to protect the project's identity and prevent bad actors from exploiting its work. The new license includes a branding restriction clause that applies to new contributions after v0.6.5, while legacy code remains BSD-3 licensed. The branding requirement means that contributors must acknowledge the project's origins and not falsely represent it as \"officially part of\" Open WebUI. The new branding clause is a minimal and carefully scoped measure to keep the project free, empowering, and driven by honest spirit. Open WebUI remains committed to transparency, openness, and supporting everyone, from hobbyists to enterprise. The project offers proprietary and enterprise licenses for businesses that need private or custom branding, advanced white-label deployments, or tailored features.", "timestamp": 1746503660.937835}
