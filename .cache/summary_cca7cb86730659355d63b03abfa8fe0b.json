{"title": "Past, present, and future of Sorbet type syntax", "summary": "Past, present, and future of Sorbet type syntax\n\nThe talk by Jake Zimmerman focuses on the past, present, and future of Sorbet type syntax. The speaker acknowledges that Sorbet's syntax is not ideal, but argues that semantics are more important than syntax. He explains that programming is an act of theory building, and types are a tool to help get the semantics from your head into the codebase. The speaker also discusses the history of Sorbet, including its origins at Stripe and its development into a static type checker. He notes that Sorbet was built in response to a need for better code organization, interfaces, and modularity, and that it has evolved over time to include features such as interface constraints and type syntax. The speaker concludes by emphasizing the importance of understanding the problem space and channeling complaints into action.", "timestamp": 1746861275.562979}
