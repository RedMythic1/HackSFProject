{"title": "The Beauty of Having a Pi-Hole (2024)", "summary": "The text discusses the use of Pi-Hole, a software that blocks DNS requests to known malicious or unwanted servers, and how it can be used to prevent apps from bypassing local DNS. The author notes that some apps, such as the New York Times app, use their own hard-coded DNS servers, which Pi-Hole cannot block. The author also mentions that some apps use DNS-over-HTTPS, which Pi-Hole cannot intercept. The author suggests that a self-hosted archive or a browser extension that learns what the user watches the most and preloads it for them could be a solution to this problem.", "timestamp": 1746491274.5397792}
