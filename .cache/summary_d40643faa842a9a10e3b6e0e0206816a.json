{"title": "Launch HN: Nao Labs (YC X25) \u2013 Cursor for Data", "summary": "Launch HN: Nao Labs (YC X25) \u2013 Cursor for Data\n\nNao Labs, a Y Combinator-backed startup, has launched an AI code editor for data manipulation. The tool, called Nao, is designed to help data teams write code relevant to their data, visualize its impact on the output, and quality check it for them. Nao is a fork of VS Code, with built-in connectors for BigQuery, Snowflake, and Postgres. It features an AI copilot and tab system, agent tools to query data, compare data, understand data tools like dbt, assess the downstream impact of code in the whole data lineage, and more. The AI tab and agent write straight away code matching the schema, may it be for SQL, Python, YAML. It shows you code diffs and data diffs side by side, to visualize what your change did to the data output. Data teams can use Nao for writing SQL pipelines, often with dbt, creating data models, documenting them, testing them, while making sure they're not breaking data lineage and figures in the BI. In run mode, they also use it to run some analytics, and identify data quality bugs in production. Nao is currently available for Mac, with Linux and Windows coming soon.", "timestamp": 1746861155.105972}
