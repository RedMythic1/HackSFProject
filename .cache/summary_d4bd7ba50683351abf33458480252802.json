{"title": "A Tektronix TDS 684B Oscilloscope Uses CCD Analog Memory", "summary": "A Tektronix TDS 684B Oscilloscope Uses CCD Analog Memory. The scope has a CCD analog memory that uses a CCD camera to capture images. The CCD camera captures images instantaneously, and the data is shifted out of the CCD at a rate that is not critical. The CCD camera is capable of measuring exact voltage and not just logic levels. The scope is rated for 25MHz because that is more than enough for scanning a screen-width's-worth of samples from the analog CCD snapshot.
