{"title": "docker2exe: Convert a Docker image to an executable", "summary": "docker2exe: Convert a Docker image to an executable\n\ndocker2exe is a tool that allows users to convert a Docker image into an executable file that can be easily shared with others. The tool requires Docker, GoLang, and gzip to be installed on the user's system. To create a new binary, the user must specify the image they want to convert and the resulting executable will be created. When the executable is run, it will check for the specified image on the user's system. If the image does not exist, the executable will automatically download it from a tarball embedded in the executable. This approach works well for small images, with the resulting executable typically under 10MB.", "timestamp": 1746597928.52614}
