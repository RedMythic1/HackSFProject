The API is available for Android, iOS, and web platforms, and uses Firebase client libraries for efficient networking and event handling. The v0 API is the first iteration and is structured as described, with no rate limit. Clients should gracefully handle additional fields they don't expect and ignore them. The API is not the ideal public API, but it is the one that could be released in the given time. It is possible to implement most of HN using it, with items identified by their unique ids and living under/v0/item/<id>.json. Users are identified by case-sensitive ids and live under/v0/user/. Firebase supports change notifications, allowing clients to subscribe to individual items and profiles, observe front page ranking, new items, and new profiles.", "timestamp": 1746861027.1401181}
