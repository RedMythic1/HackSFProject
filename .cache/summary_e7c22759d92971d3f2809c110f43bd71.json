{"title": "Kate and Python Language Server", "summary": "The text discusses the Python Language Server (LSP) and its slow response time when used with Emacs. Some users have found alternative LSP servers, such as pyright, which they find faster and more efficient. Others have recommended the Ruff server, which is not yet ready but shows promise.

Basedpyright is another alternative LSP server that can be set up on popular editors.", "timestamp": 1746489759.8639202}
