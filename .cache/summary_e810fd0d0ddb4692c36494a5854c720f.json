The API is available for Android, iOS, web, and server platforms, and is designed to handle networking efficiently and raise events when changes occur. The API is structured as described below, with no rate limit and only removal of a non-optional field or alteration of an existing field considered incompatible changes. Clients should gracefully handle additional fields they don't expect and simply ignore them. The v0 API is essentially a dump of the in-memory data structures, with items identified by their unique integer ids and living under/v0/item/<id>.json. Users are identified by case-sensitive ids and live under/v0/user/. Firebase also supports change notifications, allowing subscriptions to individual items and profiles, with the largest item id at/v0/maxitem and up to 500 top and new stories at/v0/topstories and/v0/newstories. Best stories are at/v0/beststories, and up to 200 of the latest Ask HN, Show HN, and Job stories are at/v0/askstories, /v0/showstories, and/v0/jobstories. Item and profile changes are at/v0/updates.", "timestamp": 1746503700.025915}
