{"title": "Show HN: Klavis AI \u2013 Open-source MCP integration for AI applications", "summary": "Klavis AI is an open-source project that provides an API for launching production-ready, hosted MCP servers quickly. The API also provides built-in OAuth and multi-tenancy auth support for MCP servers. The goal of Klavis AI is to simplify access to MCP servers and remove the need for developers to write MCP client code. The project offers open-source client interfaces for Web, Slack, and Discord, and the MCP servers and clients code is open source. The project aims to address key problems with using MCPs, such as the lack of native or used-based authentications and the personal nature of many MCP servers. The project is still in its early stages and welcomes feedback from the community.", "timestamp": 1746489811.1948538}
