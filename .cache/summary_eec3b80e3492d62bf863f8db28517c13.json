{"title": "The Curse of Knowing How, or; Fixing Everything", "summary": "The Curse of Knowing How, or; Fixing Everything\n\nThe text describes the author's experience of becoming a more skilled programmer and the consequences of that. Initially, the author was content to solve small problems and make the machine do what it should have done. However, as they became more skilled, they began to see flaws in software and became more critical of it. They noticed that every piece of software became a TODO list and every inconvenience became an indictment of inaction. The author describes the feeling of being condemned to push the boulder of their own systems uphill, one fix, one refactor, one script at a time. They also discuss the idea that programming lures us into believing we can control the outside events, which leads to suffering. The author concludes that the hardest thing to learn is when to leave things broken and that this is a human skill.", "timestamp": 1746512494.841098}
