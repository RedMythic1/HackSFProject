Initially, the author was content to solve small problems and make the machine do what it should have done. However, as they became more skilled, they began to see flaws in software and became more critical of it. They noticed that every piece of software became a TODO list and every inconvenience became an indictment of inaction. The author describes the feeling of guilt that comes when they realize that they built something that is now broken. They also discuss the idea that programming is a conquest of sorts, but that the imaginary war never ends. The author reflects on the idea that building things is how we self-soothe and that programming gives us instant feedback.
