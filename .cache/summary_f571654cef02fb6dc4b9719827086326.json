{"title": "Show HN: Plexe \u2013 ML Models from a Prompt", "summary": "Show HN: Plexe \u2013 ML Models from a Prompt\n\nPlexe is an AI-powered system that allows users to build machine learning models using natural language descriptions. It uses a team of specialized AI agents to build complete models with a single method call, supports distributed model training and evaluation with Ray for faster parallel processing, and can generate synthetic data or infer schemas automatically. Plexe can be used as a Python library to build and train machine learning models, and it works with most LiteLLM providers, with active testing only with openai and anthropic models. If you encounter issues with other providers, please let the team know.
