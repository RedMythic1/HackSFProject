The project uses a Sonoff S31 smart switch and an INMP441 microphone to detect screams and toggle the switch. The microphone uses I2S and is connected to the TX pin on the S31. The ESP32 board runs Arduino code to detect screams and toggle the relay. The project is easy to integrate with Home Assistant and can be used to control various devices. The project is fun and provides a unique way to control lights.", "timestamp": 1746861102.613333}
