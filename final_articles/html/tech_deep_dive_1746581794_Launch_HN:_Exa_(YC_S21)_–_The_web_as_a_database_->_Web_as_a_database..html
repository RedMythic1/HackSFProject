    <h1>Deep Dive: Launch HN: Exa (YC S21) â€“ The web as a database -> Web as a database.<br><br>
#<h1>Introduction<br><br>The traditional search engine has been the go-to tool for finding information online. However, with the rise of clickbait and the complexity of online information, it can be challenging to find the most relevant results. Exa Websets is a new search engine that takes a different approach to information retrieval. It uses embeddings-powered search technology to match the meaning of the query rather than just keywords. This allows users to find more precise results for complex queries. Exa Websets also allows users to add "enrichment" columns to find more information about each result, making it a valuable tool for researchers, journalists, and anyone looking for in-depth information. With its table-based format and focus on meaning-based search, Exa Websets is an innovative and exciting new search engine that is worth exploring.<br><br>
#<h1>Launch HN: Exa (YC S21) â€“ The web as a database -> Web as a database.<br><br>##<h1>Summary
Launch HN: Exa (YC S21) â€“ The web as a database<br><br>Exa Websets is a new search engine that uses embeddings-powered search technology to return precise results for complex queries. Unlike traditional search engines, Exa Websets focuses on matching the meaning of the query rather than just keywords. The search engine is designed to be a step in the opposite direction of the current trend towards SEO-optimized clickbait. Exa Websets is a table-based format that allows users to add "enrichment" columns to find more information about each result. The search engine is still in its early stages and is currently available for free.<br><br>
##<h1>Deep Dive Questions<br><br>###<h1>How does Launch HN: Exa (YC S21) â€“ The web as a database -> Web as a database. work in relation to Launch HN: Exa (YC S21) â€“ The web as a database?<br><br><div class='source'><strong>Source 1</strong>: [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28197537](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28197537)<br><br>SigmaOS is a new type of browser designed to help users work more efficiently on the web. It is a project that combines the obsessions of its creators, who are all power users of software that helps them organize and clean up their workflow. The browser has a radically different user experience that aims to solve the problem of information loss and overload. It allows users to create workspaces that hold apps and pages related to a project or task, and presents them in a list format. Users can quickly find pages in their history and already-open pages across workspaces, and navigate to them quickly. SigmaOS also has a split-screen feature that allows users to quickly open a second webpage, and an intuitive and easy-to-learn repertoire of keyboard shortcuts for all the most-used commands and actions. The browser connects users' web apps and browsing activity to understand the context around their actions and searches, and organizes information by projects, making it shareable and collaborative. SigmaOS charges $15 per month, with no ads and no data monetization.<br><br>

###<h1>In what ways could Exa Websets revolutionize the way we approach search and information retrieval on the web?<br><br><div class='source'><strong>Source 1</strong>: [https://www.forwardfuture.ai/p/inside-exa-the-startup-building-a-search-engine-for-the-ai-age](https://www.forwardfuture.ai/p/inside-exa-the-startup-building-a-search-engine-for-the-ai-age)<br><br>Exa is a San Francisco startup that is revolutionizing the way we search the web by building an AI-driven search engine designed to understand the intent behind queries. Unlike traditional search engines that rely heavily on keyword matching, Exa's technology is built on neural networks capable of understanding the deeper meaning behind queries. This allows Exa to provide results tailored precisely to the information that both human users and AI applications genuinely seek. Exa's unique approach excels particularly well in sophisticated, multi-criteria searches. The company's API (Application Programming Interface) enables other applications and AI systems to send queries to Exa and get back rich results in real time. Exa's marketing strategy focuses on engaging with the developer community and AI enthusiasts, highlighting concrete achievements and metrics to showcase its unique capabilities. The company's vision is to become the search backend for a variety of use cases without requiring users to visit a new search site.<br><br>
<div class='source'><strong>Source 2</strong>: [https://exa.ai/blog/websets-evals](https://exa.ai/blog/websets-evals)<br><br>In this post, Will Bryk announces the launch of their new search product, "Websets", which retrieves over 20x more correct search results than Google on complex queries. The author explains that while Google is great for simple searches, it struggles with complex ones. They built Websets to enable these valuable queries by deploying an army of agents that use a custom embedding-based search algorithm. The author then walks through a benchmark test that compares Exa Websets, Google, and OpenAI's Deep Research. They found that Exa Websets outperformed both Google and Deep Research in their benchmark. The author explains that they created a minimally-biased benchmark by using one-shot sampling from o1 and manually grading each result based on the same criteria. The graph below shows the number of matching results for each search engine, with Websets (high compute) getting the highest number of correct results per query on average. The author concludes that Websets is 20 times better than Google in their evaluation.<br><br>
###<h1>What is the significance of Launch HN: Exa (YC S21) â€“ The web as a database -> Web as a database. in the context of Launch HN: Exa (YC S21) â€“ The web as a database?<br><br><div class='source'><strong>Source 1</strong>: [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28304781](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28304781)<br><br>Evidence is a static site generator for data analysts that allows pages to be written in markdown with SQL queries running against a database. The platform includes a component library for adding charts and graphs, and it aims to provide the fundamentals of programming in a way that analysts can easily make use of. Evidence is built on Svelte and Svelte Kit, and it is currently in the early stages of development. The core framework will always be open source, and eventually a paid cloud version will be launched. The team has experience working with modern data stacks and has identified the BI layer as the weakest part of the stack. They believe that treating analytics more like software development can lead to better quality outputs and a better developer experience.<br><br>
<div class='source'><strong>Source 2</strong>: [https://chris.cothrun.com/pinboard-bookmark/launch-hn-evidence-yc-s21-web-framework-for-data-analysts-hacker-news/](https://chris.cothrun.com/pinboard-bookmark/launch-hn-evidence-yc-s21-web-framework-for-data-analysts-hacker-news/)<br><br>Evidence is a static site generator designed for data analysts, similar to Jekyll or Hugo. It allows users to write SQL queries within markdown documents, which run against a database and can be referenced using a simple templating syntax. Evidence also includes a component library for adding charts and graphs, and it is different from most BI tools in that it allows data analysts to adopt software engineering practices like version control, testing, and abstraction. The assumption that data analysts are non-technical is no longer correct, and Evidence is built to cater to their needs.<br><br>
#<h1>Conclusion<br><br>In the article "Launch HN: Exa (YC S21) â€“ The web as a database," the topic of Exa, a startup that aims to make the web into a database, is explored. The key insight is that the web is increasingly being used as a data storage platform, and Exa aims to make this process more efficient and accessible.
