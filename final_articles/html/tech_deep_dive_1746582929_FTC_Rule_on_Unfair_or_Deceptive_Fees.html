##<h1>Deep Dive Questions<br><br>###<h1>What is the FTC?<br><br><div class='source'><strong>Source 1</strong>: [https://www.ftc.gov/about-ftc](https://www.ftc.gov/about-ftc)<br><br>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is a federal agency that protects consumers from deceptive or unfair business practices and promotes fair competition in the economy. The FTC has jurisdiction over a wide range of economic sectors and pursues law enforcement, advocacy, research, and education to achieve its goals. The agency's work is performed by the Bureaus of Consumer Protection, Competition, and Economics, aided by the Office of General Counsel and eight regional offices. Since its creation in 1914, the FTC has evolved to include consumer protection laws such as the Telemarketing Sales Rule, the Pay-Per-Call Rule, and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. The FTC will never demand money or personal information from individuals and encourages them to report any illegal business practices or scams through the ReportFraud.ftc.gov website.<br><br>
<div class='source'><strong>Source 2</strong>: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission)<br><br>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is an independent agency of the United States government responsible for enforcing civil antitrust law and protecting consumers. The FTC was established in 1914 in response to the monopolistic trust crisis and has since enforced the provisions of the Clayton Antitrust Act and the FTC Act. The agency has the power to regulate a variety of industries, including the funeral home industry, and has implemented regulations such as the Funeral Ruling to protect consumers from deceptive practices. In recent years, the FTC has taken action against companies engaging in transaction laundering and producing predatory journals. The agency is composed of five commissioners who are nominated by the President and subject to Senate confirmation, and no more than three commissioners can be from the same party.<br><br>

This publication serves as a compliance guide for small entities under the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act, providing answers to common questions about the Rule's requirements. It is important to note that this is the FTC staff's view and not binding on the Commission.<br><br>
