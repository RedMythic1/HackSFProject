Microsoft's Clippy, a quirky paperclip-shaped assistant that debuted in the 1990s, was one of the first examples of artificial intelligence (AI) in everyday life. While Clippy was a pioneer in AI, its execution left much to be desired, often interrupting workflows and frustrating users. Today, Microsoft has taken AI to new heights with tools like Microsoft Copilot, which seamlessly integrates into Microsoft 365 apps to enhance productivity. While Clippy may seem like a relic of the past, it played an important role in shaping the AI-powered tools we use today. Clippy's legacy serves as a reminder of how far we've come and the lessons we've learned along the way. From Clippy to Copilot, the evolution of AI has been marked by a shift from basic algorithms to sophisticated AI models, a focus on user-centric design, and a seamless integration into workflows. As we embrace the next generation of AI, it's important to remember the lessons of Clippy and strive for AI tools that empower users without patronizing them.
