The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has finally implemented a rule that bans hidden fees in live event tickets and short-term lodging. Starting May 12, businesses must inform consumers about the total price they will have to pay for live-event tickets or short-term lodging in their ads and other promotional offers. They are allowed to hold back certain fees, such as taxes, government charges, shipping charges, and charges for optional goods or services people may select, until checkout. The total price must include all known charges and fees and be displayed more prominently than other charges. Businesses can't misrepresent additional fees and charges, either. These guidelines are applicable for live events such as concerts, sporting events, music, theater, and other performances that audiences watch live. They don't apply to pre-recorded audio and visual performances and film screenings. Airbnb has already started displaying the total price upfront ahead of the rule change.
