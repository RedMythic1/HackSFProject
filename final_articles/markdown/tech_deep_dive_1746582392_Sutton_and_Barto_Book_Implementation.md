# Deep Dive: Sutton and Barto Book Implementation


## Introduction

Reinforcement learning is an exciting field that has gained significant attention in recent years. Sutton and Barto's book "Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction" provides a comprehensive introduction to the subject, making it a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning about the field. The repository on github.com/ivanbelenky/RL contains code that implements algorithms and models from the book, organized into several modules covering different topics. The code provides a basic implementation of the algorithms, but it is not necessarily the most efficient or well-written. Despite this, the repository serves as a valuable resource for anyone looking to learn about reinforcement learning and implement algorithms from scratch. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer, the Sutton and Barto Book Implementation is an interesting and important topic to explore.


## Sutton and Barto Book Implementation

### Summary
Sutton and Barto Book Implementation

The repository on github.com/ivanbelenky/RL contains code that implements algorithms and models from Sutton's book on reinforcement learning. The book, titled "Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction, " provides a comprehensive introduction to the field. The code in this repository is organized into several modules, each covering different topics. Model-free solvers work by defining states, actions, and a transition function. Transitions are defined as a function that takes a state and an action and returns a tuple of the next state and the reward. The transition function also returns a boolean indicating whether the episode has terminated. The Single State Infinite Variance Example 5 demonstrates the use of Monte Carlo Tree Search for maze solving. While the code provides a basic implementation of the algorithms from the book, it is not necessarily the most efficient or well-written. The repository serves as a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning about reinforcement learning and implementing algorithms from scratch. However, it is not production-ready.
