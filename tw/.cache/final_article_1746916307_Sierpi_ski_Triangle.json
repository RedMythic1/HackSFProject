In this article, the author explores a simple bit-twiddling hack that produces the Sierpi\u0144ski triangle using the C programming language. The hack involves iterating over a pair of integer coordinates and coloring each cell based on whether the bitwise AND of the coordinates is zero or non-zero. The author explains that the magic of the algorithm is not in the bitwise AND operation, but in the positional numeral system. They visualize the process of counting from 0 to 63 in binary and explain how the value of the least significant bit toggles with every tick, the next bit flips back and forth at half the frequency, and so on. The algorithm is an iterative block-removal approach in disguise, with the passes \"parallelized\" by the arithmetic logic unit of a CPU. The author concludes by explaining that the hack is a simple and elegant way to produce the Sierpi\u0144ski triangle, and that the magic is in the positional numeral system. This article is a must-read for anyone interested in fractals, programming, and the power of the positional numeral system.\n\n\n## Sierpi\u0144ski Triangle.\n\n### Summary\nSierpi\u0144ski Triangle? In My Bitwise and?\n\nThe text describes the author's enthusiasm for the C programming language and their previous writing about fractals. The author then goes on to explain a simple bit-twiddling hack that produces the Sierpi\u0144ski triangle, a well-known fractal. The hack involves iterating over a pair of integer coordinates and coloring each cell based on whether the bitwise AND of the coordinates is zero or non-zero. The author explains that the magic of the algorithm is not in the bitwise AND operation, but in the positional numeral system. They visualize the process of counting from 0 to 63 in binary and explain how the value of the least significant bit toggles with every tick, the next bit flips back and forth at half the frequency, and so on. The author then goes on to explain how the MSB of the x & y operation divides the x and y axes into two halves, producing four quadrants in the two-dimensional plot. The algorithm is an iterative block-removal approach in disguise, with the passes \"parallelized\" by the arithmetic logic unit of a CPU. The author concludes by explaining that the hack is a simple and elegant way to produce the Sierpi\u0144ski triangle, and that the magic is in the positional numeral system.\n\n\n### Deep Dive Questions\n\n#### What is the mathematical concept of recursion and how does it relate to the Sierpi\u0144ski Triangle?\n\nRecursion is a mathematical concept where a function or algorithm calls itself repeatedly until a specific condition is met. It is a powerful tool for solving complex problems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable subproblems.\nIn the case of the Sierpi\u0144ski Triangle, recursion is used to divide the triangle into smaller and smaller triangles until they reach a specific level of detail. The Sierpi\u0144ski Triangle is a mathematical object that is formed by repeatedly applying a recursive algorithm to a square. The algorithm divides the square into four congruent right-angled triangles, then divides each of those triangles into four congruent right-angled triangles, and so on, until the triangles are very small.\nThe recursive nature of the Sierpi\u0144ski Triangle allows for the creation of infinite patterns and shapes by repeating the same algorithm over and over again. This concept is also used in other areas of mathematics, such as fractals and self-similarity.\n\n\n#### How does the Sierpi\u0144ski Triangle demonstrate the concept of self-similarity in geometry and mathematics?\n\nThe Sierpi\u0144ski Triangle is a mathematical concept that demonstrates the concept of self-similarity in geometry and mathematics. It is a triangle that is divided into smaller and smaller triangles, each with the same shape and size as the original. This process of division continues indefinitely, creating a fractal pattern that exhibits infinite detail and complexity.\nThe Sierpi\u0144ski Triangle is a self-similar shape because it exhibits the same shape and structure at every level of detail. This means that no matter how closely you look at the triangle, you will always see the same basic shape and structure. This self-similarity is a fundamental property of fractals and is a key feature of many natural phenomena, such as coastlines, snowflakes, and plants.\nIn the case of the Sierpi\u0144ski Triangle, the self-similarity is achieved through the process of division. The triangle is divided into smaller and smaller triangles, each with the same shape and size as the original. This process continues indefinitely, creating a fractal pattern that exhibits infinite detail and complexity.\nOverall, the Sierpi\u0144ski Triangle is a powerful tool for demonstrating the concept of self\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Sierpi\u0144ski Triangle is a mathematical concept that has been studied for decades. It is a fractal that can be generated by repeatedly dividing a square into nine smaller squares, then dividing each of those smaller squares into nine even smaller squares, and so on. This concept has been applied in various fields, including computer science, art, and mathematics. One of the key insights is that the Sierpi\u0144ski Triangle has an infinite number of iterations, meaning that it can be divided into an infinite number of smaller squares. This property has important implications for computer science, as it can be used to create efficient algorithms for image compression and data compression.
