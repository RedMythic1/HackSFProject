[{"url": null, "summary": "In economics, scarcity refers to a situation where the demand for a particular good or service exceeds the available supply. This creates a competition among buyers to acquire the limited resources, leading to higher prices. \nScarcity is an important concept in economics because it determines the pricing strategies that businesses use to allocate resources. When there is a scarcity of a particular good or service, businesses can charge higher prices because consumers are willing to pay more to acquire it. However, if the supply of the good or service increases, the price will decrease to attract more buyers. \nIn addition, businesses may also use other pricing strategies such as bundling, where they offer a combination of goods or services at a discounted price, or differentiation, where they offer a unique feature that justifies a higher price. Overall, the concept of scarcity plays a crucial role in determining pricing strategies and allocating resources efficiently in a market economy.", "is_pdf": false}]
