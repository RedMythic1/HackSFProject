[{"url": null, "summary": "Remission is a term used in medicine to describe a significant reduction or disappearance of symptoms of a disease or condition. It is typically used to describe a period of time during which a patient experiences improvement or resolution of their symptoms, often following some form of medical treatment. In oncology, remission refers to the disappearance of cancer cells or tumors, and can be achieved through various treatments such as chemotherapy, surgery, or immunotherapy. Remission is an important goal for many patients, as it can improve their quality of life and increase their chances of long-term survival. However, it is important to note that remission does not necessarily mean that the disease has been cured, and patients may still require ongoing treatment and monitoring to prevent a recurrence.", "is_pdf": false}]
