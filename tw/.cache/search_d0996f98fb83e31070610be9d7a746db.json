[{"url": null, "summary": "The principle of supply and demand is an economic theory that explains the interaction between buyers and sellers in the market, determining the price and quantity of goods and services exchanged. In simple terms, when demand for a good or service increases, and the supply remains the same, the price will increase. Conversely, when demand decreases and the supply remains the same, the price will decrease. This relationship between supply, demand, and price is fundamental to understanding how markets work.\n\nIn practice, the principle of supply and demand affects pricing in many ways. For example, when there is a shortage of a particular good or service, suppliers can charge a higher price because people are willing to pay more to obtain it. On the other hand, if there is an excess supply of a good or service, prices will tend to be lower, as suppliers compete with each other to attract buyers.\n\nOverall, the principle of supply and demand is a key concept in economics, helping to explain how prices are determined in a market economy.", "is_pdf": false}]
