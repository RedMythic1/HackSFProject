# HackSF Project Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified

1. **Vercel Blob Access Denied Error**
   - Log: `Error listing blobs: Vercel Blob: Access denied, please provide a valid token for this resource.`
   - Cause: The Vercel deployment doesn't have the proper Blob storage token configured in environment variables.

2. **Missing File Error**
   - Log: `Skipping article /tmp/final_article_final_article_1746916855_PLAttice.json - could not read file`
   - Cause: The API is trying to read a temporary file that doesn't exist or attempting to access a Blob that has path formatting issues.
   
3. **Duplicated Prefix Error**
   - Log: `Skipping article /tmp/final_article_final_article_1746915309_US_vs_Google_amicus_curiae_brief_of_Y_Combinator_in_support_of_plaintiffs.json - could not read file`
   - Cause: Some file paths have duplicated `final_article_` prefixes, causing path resolution issues.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Vercel Blob Token Configuration

- Added proper environment variables to `vercel.json`:
  ```json
  "env": {
    "BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN": "vercel_blob_rw_MzCMzRmJaiRlp3km_L5RVXS9InB9rTT1Aov2ZI4kzQFoT5S",
    "BLOB_URL": "https://mzcmzrmjairlp3km.public.blob.vercel-storage.com"
  }
  ```

- Created `update-vercel.sh` script to update deployment with the correct environment variables

### 2. Improved File Error Handling

- Updated `safeReadFile()` in `server.js` to better handle missing files
- Enhanced error reporting and fallback mechanisms
- Added validation to skip invalid file paths
- Improved handling of temporary files

### 3. Better Error Reporting

- Created a public `env-check.js` endpoint to verify environment variables
- Created a tool `check-vercel-env.js` to test Vercel environment configuration
- Added detailed logging for better debugging

### 4. Validation of Blob Storage

- Created `test-blob.js` to validate Blob Storage connectivity
- Created `fix-article-issues.js` to identify and fix problematic blobs

### 5. Fixed Duplicated Prefixes Issue

- Modified `getBlobKeyFromPath()` in `server.js` to handle duplicated `final_article_` prefixes
- Modified `getVirtualPathFromBlobKey()` to create clean file paths
- Created `fix-duplicate-prefixes.js` to identify and fix existing blob keys with duplicated prefixes
- Updated `update-vercel.sh` to run the prefix fixing script during deployment

## Deployment Instructions

1. Test local blob access:
   ```bash
   source setup-env.sh
   node tools/test-blob.js
   ```

2. Fix any problematic article files:
   ```bash
   node tools/fix-article-issues.js
   ```

3. Fix any duplicated prefixes in blob keys:
   ```bash
   node tools/fix-duplicate-prefixes.js
   ```

4. Update your Vercel deployment:
   ```bash
   chmod +x update-vercel.sh
   ./update-vercel.sh
   ```

5. Verify the deployment environment:
   ```bash
   node tools/check-vercel-env.js
   ```

## Monitoring

Once deployed, monitor the application logs. If you continue to see "file not found" errors, you can:

1. Run the `fix-article-issues.js` script to identify and remove problematic blobs
2. Run the `fix-duplicate-prefixes.js` script to fix any remaining duplicated prefixes
3. Check your Vercel project settings to ensure environment variables are properly set
4. Check the public `/api/env-check` endpoint to verify settings
