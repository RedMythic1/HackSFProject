# Vercel Deployment Guide

This project has been adapted to run on Vercel's serverless platform. The following guide explains how the application is structured and how to deploy it.

## Project Structure

- `/api` - Contains serverless functions that replace the Flask backend
- `/src` - Frontend TypeScript source code
- `/public` - Static assets
- `/dist` - Build output (generated by webpack)

## How It Works

1. The frontend is a static React/TypeScript application built with webpack
2. The backend API has been converted to Node.js serverless functions
3. Caching and data storage uses Vercel's persistent storage

## Configuration Files

- `vercel.json` - Configures routes, builds, and functions
- `api/index.js` - Main API handler (Express.js app)
- `package.json` - Updated with Vercel-compatible scripts

## Deployment Steps

1. Make sure you have the Vercel CLI installed:
   ```
   npm i -g vercel
   ```

2. Log in to Vercel:
   ```
   vercel login
   ```

3. Deploy the project:
   ```
   vercel
   ```

4. Follow the CLI prompts to configure your deployment

## Important Changes

- Backend code has been converted from Python (Flask) to Node.js (Express)
- API endpoints now use relative paths instead of hardcoded URLs
- File system operations use Vercel's ephemeral filesystem and cache directories
- Caching mechanism has been simplified to work with Vercel's limitations

## Limitations

- Vercel has a 50MB limit for lambda functions
- Serverless functions have a 10-second execution time limit on Hobby plan
- Local file operations are more limited than in the original Flask app

## Local Development

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Start the backend API:
   ```
   npm run backend
   ```

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter memory issues, try reducing the middleware complexity in `api/index.js`
- For timeout issues, split complex operations into multiple API endpoints
- Check Vercel logs for detailed error information
