[{"url": null, "summary": "Class weighting is a technique used in machine learning to address imbalanced learning, which occurs when one class or category has significantly more samples than another. In such cases, the model may be biased towards the majority class and perform poorly on the minority class. Class weighting helps to address this issue by assigning higher weights to the minority class samples during training, which gives them more importance in the model's decision-making process. This helps the model to learn from the minority class samples more effectively and improve its performance on that class. Overall, class weighting helps to ensure that the model is trained on a more balanced dataset and can better generalize to new, unseen data.", "is_pdf": false}]
