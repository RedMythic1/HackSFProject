[{"url": null, "summary": "Recursion is a mathematical concept where a function or algorithm calls itself repeatedly until a specific condition is met. It is a powerful tool for solving complex problems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable subproblems.\nIn the case of the Sierpi\u0144ski Triangle, recursion is used to divide the triangle into smaller and smaller triangles until they reach a specific level of detail. The Sierpi\u0144ski Triangle is a mathematical object that is formed by repeatedly applying a recursive algorithm to a square. The algorithm divides the square into four congruent right-angled triangles, then divides each of those triangles into four congruent right-angled triangles, and so on, until the triangles are very small.\nThe recursive nature of the Sierpi\u0144ski Triangle allows for the creation of infinite patterns and shapes by repeating the same algorithm over and over again. This concept is also used in other areas of mathematics, such as fractals and self-similarity.", "is_pdf": false}]
