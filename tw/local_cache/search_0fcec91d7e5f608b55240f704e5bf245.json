[{"url": null, "summary": "Imbalanced learning refers to the situation where the data used to train a machine learning algorithm is not evenly distributed. One class or category may have significantly more data points than another. This can lead to biased predictions and poor performance of the algorithm. \nIn imbalanced learning, the algorithm tends to perform well on the majority class, but struggles with the minority class. This can result in incorrect predictions and poor accuracy. To address this issue, various techniques such as oversampling, undersampling, and synthetic data generation can be used to balance the data and improve the performance of the algorithm.", "is_pdf": false}]
