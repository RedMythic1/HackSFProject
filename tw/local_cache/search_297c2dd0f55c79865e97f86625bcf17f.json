[{"url": null, "summary": "An amicus curiae brief, also known as a \"friend of the court\" brief, is a legal document filed in a case by a non-party who has an interest in the outcome of the case, but is not directly affected by the outcome. The purpose of the brief is to provide the court with information and arguments that may assist the court in making its decision. Amicus curiae briefs are often filed by organizations or individuals who wish to provide the court with information or arguments on a matter of public interest, such as a constitutional issue or a matter that affects the broader community. The court is not obligated to accept or consider an amicus curiae brief, but it may choose to do so if it determines that the brief provides valuable information or arguments that will assist the court in making its decision.", "is_pdf": false}]
