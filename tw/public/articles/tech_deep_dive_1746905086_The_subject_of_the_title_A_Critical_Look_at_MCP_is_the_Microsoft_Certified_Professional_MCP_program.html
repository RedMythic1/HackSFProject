    <h1>Deep Dive: The subject of the title "A Critical Look at MCP" is the Microsoft Certified Professional (MCP) program.<br><br>
#<h1>Introduction<br><br>The Microsoft Certified Professional (MCP) program is a topic of interest for many professionals in the tech industry. In this article, the author takes a critical look at the MCP program and argues that it is poorly engineered with subpar documentation and implementation guidance. The author also criticizes the protocol's transport protocol, which is based on Server-Sent Events (SSE) and Streamable HTTP, and argues that it should be replaced with something that mimics stdio. The article provides an example of implementing an MCP server in Golang, but found the documentation and implementation to be poor. The author concludes that the industry should optimize for the most common use-cases and not the corner-cases, and that WebSockets are the appropriate choice for transport over HTTP. This article is important for professionals in the tech industry who are considering the MCP program and want to make an informed decision about its effectiveness and potential drawbacks.<br><br>
#<h1>The subject of the title "A Critical Look at MCP" is the Microsoft Certified Professional (MCP) program.<br><br>##<h1>Summary
A Critical Look at MCP<br><br>The text discusses the Model Context Protocol (MCP), an open protocol that aims to standardize how applications provide context to LLMs. The author argues that MCP is poorly engineered, with subpar documentation and implementation guidance. They also criticize the protocol's transport protocol, which is based on Server-Sent Events (SSE) and Streamable HTTP, and argue that it should be replaced with something that mimics stdio. The author also provides an example of implementing an MCP server in Golang, but found the documentation and implementation to be poor. They conclude that the industry should optimize for the most common use-cases and not the corner-cases, and that WebSockets are the appropriate choice for transport over HTTP.<br><br>
